  abstract  = {Sensors play an important role in the monitoring and decision making of autonomous systems. However, the sensor measurements suffer from the addition of random noise due to various reasons. These noisy observations affect the decisions taken by the sensory system. Removal of noise is a critical aspect of any such system. This paper presents an optimization based novel procedure for cleaning the noisy sensor measurements. The proposed algorithm is designed with the help of a well-known particle swarm optimization technique. The developed algorithm is tested with the simulated standard data having different noise intensities and validated with the help of real-time measurements taken using the gyroscope sensor. Results show the feasibility of using the optimization based algorithm for cleaning the sensory data.},

  abstract  = {Nowadays, wireless sensor networks have been widely used in many monitoring applications. Due to the low quality of sensors and random effects of the environments, however, it is well known that the collected sensor data are noisy. Therefore, it is very critical to clean the sensor data before using them to answer queries or conduct data analysis. Popular data cleaning approaches, such as the moving average, cannot meet the requirements of both energy efficiency and quick response time in many sensor related applications. In this paper, we propose a hybrid sensor data cleaning approach with confidence. Specifically, we propose a smart weighted moving average (WMA) algorithm that collects confidence data from sensors and computes the weighted moving average. The rationale behind the WMA algorithm is to draw more samples for a particular value that is of great importance to the moving average, and provide higher confidence weight for this value, such that this important value can be quickly reflected in the moving average. Based on our extensive simulation results, we demonstrate that, compared to the simple moving average (SMA), our WMA approach can effectively clean data and offer quick response time.},

  abstract       = {Real-world datasets are often contaminated with label noise; labeling is not a clear-cut process and reliable methods tend to be expensive or time-consuming. Depending on the learning technique used, such label noise is potentially harmful, requiring an increased size of the training set, making the trained model more complex and more prone to overfitting and yielding less accurate prediction. This work proposes a cleaning technique called the ensemble method based on the noise detection metric (ENDM). From the corrupted training set, an ensemble classifier is first learned and used to derive four metrics assessing the likelihood for a sample to be mislabeled. For each metric, three thresholds are set to maximize the classifying performance on a corrupted validation dataset when using three different ensemble classifiers, namely Bagging, AdaBoost and k-nearest neighbor (k-NN). These thresholds are used to identify and then either remove or correct the corrupted samples. The effectiveness of the ENDM is demonstrated in performing the classification of 15 public datasets. A comparative analysis is conducted concerning the homogeneous-ensembles-based majority vote method and consensus vote method, two popular ensemble-based label noise filters.},
