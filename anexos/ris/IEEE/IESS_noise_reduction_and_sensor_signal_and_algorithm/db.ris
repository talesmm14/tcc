AB  - Capacitive electrocardiogram (ECG) sensors have been developed as a non-intrusive measurement to obtain ECG in daily life. However, the sensors are sensitive to motion noise caused by user's movement so that this paper suggests a novel noise reduction using active noise cancellation (ANC) with multichannel signals. The proposed algorithm can detect reliable QRS interval and conserve its power while noise is reduced outside the interval. As a result, the proposed algorithm achieved more accurate R peak detection of ECG measured in driving situation than single channel ANC. The method will be useful in the filed reducing noise of multichannel biomedical signal.

AB  - The paper presents distributed algorithms for combined acoustic echo cancellation (AEC) and noise reduction (NR) in a wireless acoustic sensor and actuator network (WASAN) where each node may have multiple microphones and multiple loudspeakers, and where the desired signal is a speech signal. A centralized integrated AEC and NR algorithm, i.e., multichannel Wiener filter (MWF), is used as starting point where echo signals are viewed as background noise signals and loudspeaker signals are used as additional input signals to the algorithm. By including prior knowledge (PK), namely that the loudspeaker signals do not contain any desired signal component, an alternative centralized cascade algorithm (PK-MWF) is obtained with an AEC stage first followed by an MWF-based NR stage which has a lower computational complexity. Distributed algorithms can then be obtained from the MWF and PK-MWF algorithm, i.e., the generalized eigenvalue decomposition (GEVD)-based distributed adaptive node-specific signal estimation (DANSE) and PK-GEVD-DANSE algorithm, respectively. In the former, each node performs a reduced dimensional integrated AEC and NR algorithm and broadcasts only 1 fused signal (instead of all its signals) to the other nodes. In the PK-GEVD-DANSE algorithm, each node performs a reduced dimensional cascade AEC and NR algorithm and broadcasts only 2 fused signals (instead of all its signals) to the other nodes. The distributed algorithms achieve the same performance, upon convergence, as the corresponding centralized integrated (MWF) and centralized cascade (PK-MWF) algorithm. It is observed, however, that the communication cost in the PK-GEVD-DANSE algorithm can also be reduced, where each node then broadcasts only 1 fused signal (instead of 2 signals) to the other nodes. The resulting algorithm, referred to as the pruned PK-GEVD-DANSE (pPK-GEVD-DANSE) algorithm, then effectively combines the lowest possible communication cost (as low as in the GEVD-DANSE algorithm) with a lowest possible computational complexity in each node (further reduced from the PK-GEVD-DANSE computational complexity), within the class of algorithms considered in this paper.

AB  - In navigation work, the geomagnetic sensor signal is susceptible to interference, so the calibration process is necessary to compensate sensor model error. However, we found the noise error in the geomagnetic sensor leads to a considerable calculation error in the calibration coefficient matrix, which is a big obstacle in obtaining the accurate signal. To improve the calibration effect, this paper analysis the characteristic of geomagnetic sensor's noise error, and then proposes the improved Hilbert-Huang transform (IHHT) algorithm to preprocessing these noise before calibration. IHHT creatively proposes an attention Hilbert spectrum, which is robust to strong noise recognition and localization. The adaptive median filtering is employed on strong noise regions. Additionally, a similarity criterion for Intrinsic Mode Function (IMF) processing is presented to save computational resources and time. Confirmed by simulation, IHHT algorithm depresses noise to be close to 0 mGuass, and declines sample variance to 13.963 mGuass2, which shows effective noise reduction capability. The experiment result shows IHHT algorithm considerably enhances calibration performance, as the calibration error drops by more than 50% compared with the results using state-of-the-art methods.

AB  - With the emergence of new sensing technologies, soft substrate-based displacement sensing has gained popularity in the last decade. Nevertheless, performance degradation due to noise from unexpected vibrations of the substrate can affect the sensor's accuracy and lead to poor measurements. Few studies have focused on noise reduction to improve the accuracy of the sensing data. Based on mathematical modeling, this paper compares the two most representative filtering algorithms based on minimum mean square error (MMSE), namely recursive least squares (RLS) and Kalman algorithms for their predictive ability, accuracy, and reliability. Based on the modeling and comparison, we propose a Kalman filtering algorithm to suppress the vibration noise in the displacement-based dosage sensor. The filter-processed data from the sensor's measurement mainly contains the actual resistance change upon mechanical displacement of the sensor substrate and the undesired noise from its vibration. With the filtering algorithm, the noise can be reduced from the sensor's measurement, and an accurate correlation between resistance change and displacement of the sensor can be established. This would provide a straightforward sensing signal that reflects the displacement, and in turn, achieves precise dosage monitoring in drug delivery devices, which can be used as a test-bed application for the sensor.

AB  - Objective: Here, we review the theory of suppression of spatially uncorrelated, sensor-specific noise in electro- and magentoencephalography (EEG and MEG) arrays, and introduce a novel method for suppression. Our method requires only that the signals of interest are spatially oversampled, which is a reasonable assumption for many EEG and MEG systems. Methods: Our method is based on a leave-one-out procedure using overlapping temporal windows in a mathematical framework to project spatially uncorrelated noise in the temporal domain. Results: This method, termed “oversampled temporal projection” (OTP), has four advantages over existing methods. First, sparse channel-specific artifacts are suppressed while limiting mixing with other channels, whereas existing linear, time-invariant spatial operators can spread such artifacts to other channels with a spatial distribution which can be mistaken for one produced by an electrophysiological source. Second, OTP minimizes distortion of the spatial configuration of the data. During source localization (e.g., dipole fitting), many spatial methods require corresponding modification of the forward model to avoid bias, while OTP does not. Third, noise suppression factors at the sensor level are maintained during source localization, whereas bias compensation removes the denoising benefit for spatial methods that require such compensation. Fourth, OTP uses a time-window duration parameter to control the tradeoff between noise suppression and adaptation to time-varying sensor characteristics. Conclusion: OTP efficiently optimizes noise suppression performance while controlling for spatial bias of the signal of interest. Significance: This is important in applications where sensor noise significantly limits the signal-to-noise ratio, such as high-frequency brain oscillations.

AB  - The traditional denoising algorithm can reduce the noise from environment, yet an evident downside of this is the sharp decrease of efficacy under non-stationary noise with low signal to noise ratio (SNR). In this case, this paper presents a denoising algorithm for environmental sound based on non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) and optimally-modified log-spectral amplitude (OMLSA). First of all, prior information is obtained from the noise and environmental sound dataset to separate the noise from noisy sound using supervised NMF. Then, decision-direction approach (DD) is used to calculate a priori SNR estimation according to the power spectral density (PSD) of the separated noise. Finally, under the log minimum mean square error criterion, the OMLSA gain function is obtained to filter out the noise in the environment. In this paper, the performance of the proposed algorithm is tested with white noise, F16 and babble under -5dB, 0dB and 5dB SNR conditions respectively. The experimental results show that this algorithm has strong ability of filtering out the noise superimposed in the environmental sound and improving the SNR gains. Moreover, comparing with other noise suppression algorithms, the proposed algorithm preforms better in preserving weak environmental sound, significantly reducing environmental sound distortion and avoiding the introduction of musical noise.

AB  - A dual-adaptive denoising algorithm based on complementary ensemble empirical mode decomposition (CEEMD) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) is proposed to improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of Brillouin optical time domain analysis (BOTDA) sensor. Here, CEEMD is employed to decompose the measurement signal into a series of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) adaptively and accurately. The spectrum centroid method is applied to quantify objectively the range of denoising. Then PSO threshold algorithm is dedicatedly designed to search for the optimal/sub-optimal denoising threshold for noised IMFs, which can adjust the threshold size adaptively according to the noise level of input signal. The results show that the SNR can be improved by more than 14 dB and the Brillouin frequency shift (BFS) accuracy is optimized by 1.12 MHz in 22.5 km sensing fiber. This algorithm does not need any condition prediction in the process of denoising, which offers an adaptation and high SNR demodulation scheme for BOTDA sensor with only modifying the software.

AB  - The phase-sensitive optical time domain reflectometry ( $\Phi $ -OTDR) system has been gradually applied to vertical seismic profile exploration due to its excellent anti-electromagnetic interference, extremely high resolution and sensitivity, and wide detection range. However, the actual data is often disturbed by random noise, which seriously affects the system’s ability to recognize low-frequency disturbances. In order to suppress the background noise and improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), a fusion noise reduction method based on empirical mode decomposition and time-frequency peak filtering (EMD-TFPF) algorithm is studied and introduced. In terms of seismic exploration data processing, the algorithm has good denoising performance. Using the  $\Phi $ -OTDR system based on optical synchronous reference heterodyne detection as the experimental platform, the EMD-TFPF noise reduction algorithm is applied to the position information and compared with the VSS-NLMS, VMD-NWT and EMD-soft methods. Experimental results show that under the conditions of 0.1 Hz and 5 V vibration interference, the EMD-TFPF method improves the SNR to 37.6 dB, which is much higher than the other three noise reduction algorithms. In addition, this method broadens the low-frequency response range of the system to 10−5 Hz. The improvement of the system’s ability to recognize low-frequency disturbance events will undoubtedly accelerate the practical process of the  $\Phi $ -OTDR system in seismic exploration.

AB  - The use of helium recycling systems for magnetoencephalography (MEG) has rapidly expanded in recent years. Placing the cryocooler close to the MEG cryostat is expected to aid in achieving a high helium-recycling efficiency. However, the cryocooler typically introduces a large amount of magnetic interference in the MEG system owing to mechanical vibration, and electric and magnetic noise. In this study, we proposed a mobile reference sensor method using fluxgate magnetometers and vibration meters to reduce the noise originating from the cryocooler. We placed the MEG cryostat, which included superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID)-based MEG sensors and reference magnetometers, and a pulse-tube cryocooler inside a magnetically shielded room. We recorded the vibration and magnetic noise during the operation of the cryocooler using the vibration meters and fluxgate magnetometers placed on the cryocooler and reference SQUID magnetometers as the reference noise data. A noise reduction algorithm named time-shift principal component analysis (TSPCA) was applied to the recorded MEG sensor data by employing the reference noise data. A noise reduction ratio of –39 dB was achieved without temporal and spatial distortion of the MEG signal using an MEG phantom. Thus, we conclude that the mobile reference sensor method with the TSPCA algorithm is an effective technique for reducing the magnetic noise originating from the cryocooler.

AB  - Based on the analysis of the signal noise characteristics of inertial navigation accelerometer, the noise in the wavelet domain is deeply studied. In order to solve the limitation of traditional Fourier filtering method in dealing with non-linear noise such as Gauss white noise, this paper optimizes the existing wavelet theory from two aspects of threshold estimation and threshold processing function, and proposes a new wavelet threshold denoising algorithm, which can effectively improve the performance of wavelet algorithm and simplify the calculation of wavelet analysis; on this basis, a new wavelet threshold denoising algorithm is proposed. The implementation of the wavelet threshold algorithm on the FPGA is studied. Finally, the system performance test shows that the new wavelet algorithm is superior to the traditional Fourier filter and the traditional wavelet filter in improving the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and reducing the root mean square error, and meets the real-time requirements of signal processing.

AB  - Distributed combined acoustic echo cancellation (AEC) and noise reduction (NR) in a wireless acoustic sensor network (WASN) is tackled by using a specific version of the PK-GEVD-DANSE algorithm (cfr. [1]). Although this algorithm was initially developed for distributed NR with partial prior knowledge of the desired speech steering vector, it is shown that it can also be used for AEC combined with NR. Simulations have been carried out using centralized and distributed batch-mode implementations to verify the performance of the algorithm in terms of AEC quantified with the echo return loss enhancement (ERLE), as well as in terms of the NR quantified with the signal- to-noise ratio (SNR).

In order to solve this problem, the noise reduction method based on the sparse representation of the aero-engine gas path electrostatic signal was studied. The electrostatic signal of a civil aviation turbofan RB211 aero-engine test record was selected as the experimental data, which effectively removed the noise interference in the original signal, verifies the effectiveness of the proposed method. The processing of aero-engine gas path electrostatic signal can effectively provide early warning of engine operating status and improve safety margins.

AB  - In large-scale wireless acoustic sensor networks (WASNs), many of the sensors will only have a marginal contribution to a certain estimation task. Involving all sensors increases the energy budget unnecessarily and decreases the lifetime of the WASN. Using microphone subset selection, also termed as sensor selection, the most informative sensors can be chosen from a set of candidate sensors to achieve a prescribed inference performance. In this paper, we consider microphone subset selection for minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) beamformer based noise reduction. The best subset of sensors is determined by minimizing the transmission cost while constraining the output noise power (or signal-to-noise ratio). Assuming the statistical information on correlation matrices of the sensor measurements is available, the sensor selection problem for this model-driven scheme is first solved by utilizing convex optimization techniques. In addition, to avoid estimating the statistics related to all the candidate sensors beforehand, we also propose a data-driven approach to select the best subset using a greedy strategy. The performance of the greedy algorithm converges to that of the model-driven method, while it displays advantages in dynamic scenarios as well as on computational complexity. Compared to a sparse MVDR or radius-based beamformer, experiments show that the proposed methods can guarantee the desired performance with significantly less transmission costs.

AB  - Noise is present in everyday life, that it is a fact to find it in everything. Depending on the applications, the noise can present or not issues. In sensing process, the noise would be a huge issue when the accuracy of the system is high, when the resolution of the sensor is better than, e.g., 40 mV/A. In this case, the outputs less than 3A have a high SNR. If these signals are used in signals processing, depending on its focus, they can provoke malfunctions and false positives. This paper presents, a methodology for noise reduction based on the sparse representation of a signal using a dictionary based on Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and Discrete Sine Transform (DST). The proposed method is tested with synthetic signals to research its effectiveness, and then it is tested with real signals taken from the current that supply Induction Motors. After the methodology is applied, signals are analyzed to prove that the information contained is preserved. The noise reduction of the current signals was ~30dB with the Motor under normal operating conditions.

AB  - In this paper, we propose a rate-distributed linearly constrained minimum variance (LCMV) beamformer for joint noise reduction and spatial cue preservation for assistive hearing in wireless acoustic sensor networks (WASNs). The WASN can consist of wireless communicating hearing aids, extended with additional wireless microphones. Due to the fact that each sensor node has a limited power budget, it is essential to consider the energy usage when designing algorithms for such WASNs. As the energy usage in terms of data transmission is directly affected by the communication rate, the proposed method optimally distributes the bit rate for each microphone node. The rate distribution is obtained by minimizing the total transmission costs under constraints on the noise reduction performance and spatial cue preservation of interfering sources. In contrast to sensor selection, i.e., binary decisions on the usefulness of a node, rate distribution allows for soft decisions, and, will lead to more degrees of freedom for joint noise reduction and spatial cue preservation than sensor selection. Numerical results show that given a certain noise reduction requirement, the proposed method displays improved energy efficiency and can preserve the spatial cues of more interferers compared to sensor selection approaches.

AB  - In wireless acoustic sensor networks (WASNs), sensors typically have a limited energy budget as they are often battery-driven. Energy efficiency is, therefore, essential for the design of algorithms in WASNs. One way to reduce energy costs is to select only the sensors that are most informative, a problem known as sensor selection . In this way, only sensors that significantly contribute to the task at hand will be involved. In this paper, we consider a more general approach, which is based on rate-distributed spatial filtering. Depending on the distance over which a transmission takes place, the bit rate directly influences the energy consumption. We try to minimize the battery usage due to transmission, while constraining the noise reduction performance. This results in an efficient rate allocation strategy, which depends on the underlying signal statistics, as well as the distance from sensors to a fusion center (FC). Through the utilization of a linearly constrained minimum variance beamformer, the problem is derived as a semidefinite program. Furthermore, we show that rate allocation is more general than sensor selection, and sensor selection can be seen as a special case of the presented rate-allocation solution, e.g., the best microphone subset can be determined by thresholding the rates. Finally, numerical simulations for estimating several target sources in a WASN demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the sensor-selection-based approaches in terms of energy usage, and we find that the sensors close to the FC and point sources are allocated with higher rates.

AB  - Wireless acoustic sensor networks (WASNs) can be used for centralized multi-microphone noise reduction, where the processing is done in a fusion center (FC). To perform the noise reduction, the data needs to be transmitted to the FC. Considering the limited battery life of the devices in a WASN, the total data rate at which the FC can communicate with the different network devices should be constrained. In this article, we propose a rate-constrained multi-microphone noise reduction algorithm, which jointly finds the best rate allocation and estimation weights for the microphones across all frequencies. The optimal linear estimators are found to be the quantized Wiener filters, and the rates are the solutions to a filter-dependent reverse water-filling problem. The performance of the proposed framework is evaluated using simulations in terms of mean square error and predicted speech intelligibility. The results show that the proposed method is very close in performance to that of the existing optimal method based on discrete optimization. However, the proposed approach can do this at a much lower complexity, while the existing optimal reference method needs a non-tractable exhaustive search to find the best rate allocation across microphones.

AB  - Doppler sensors are commonly used for movement detection and speed measurement. However, electromagnetic interferences and imperfections in sensor construction result in degradation of the signal to noise ratio. As a result, detection of signals reflected from moving objects becomes problematic. The paper proposes an algorithm for reduction of distortions and noise in the signal received from a simple, dual-channel type of a Doppler sensor. The proposed method is based on examining phase relationship between I/Q channels of the sensor signal. A weighting function is calculated in order to suppress the distortions while preserving energy of the desired signal. Additionally, the proposed algorithm may select signals reflected by objects moving in a specific direction (e.g. towards the sensor). The processed signal may be further analyzed in order to detect signal frequency and compute the object velocity. The results of the experiments show that the proposed approach results in significant reduction of level of noise and interferences, allowing for detection and tracking of signals reflected from moving objects.

It is shown that the centralized version is able to have better attenuation and tracking performance for different step sizes, ideal and noisy plant models. It is also shown that the proposed distributed version using an incremental communication strategy can obtain a better noise reduction performance is a proper step is used. These performance improvements over the NLMS solutions are obtained with a price of a slight increase in the numerical complexity.

AB  - A new support identification technique based on factor graphs and belief propagation is proposed for compressive sensing (CS) aided wireless sensor networks (WSNs), which reliably estimates the locations of non-zero entries in a sparse signal through an iterative process. Our factor graph based approach achieves a support identification error rate of 10% at an signal to noise ratio (SNR) that is 6 dB lower than that required by the state-of-the-art relative frequency based support identification approach, as well as by the orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) algorithm. We also demonstrate that our support identification technique is capable of mitigating the signal reconstruction noise by as much as 4 dB upon pruning the sparse sensing matrix. Furthermore, by intrinsically amalgamating the relative frequency based and the proposed factor graph based approach, we conceived a hybrid support identification technique for reducing communication between the sensor nodes and the fusion center (FC), while maintaining high-accuracy support identification and simultaneously mitigating the noise contaminating signal reconstruction.

AB  - In this paper, we present a novel K times singular value decomposition (K-SVD) based denoising algorithm dedicated to the division-of-focal-plane (DoFP) polarization image sensors. The proposed method is based on sparse representation over trained dictionary. Using the proposed K-SVD algorithm to update the dictionary, the image content can be more effectively expressed. Compared with the previous denoising algorithms, the proposed implementation is capable of decomposing the input DoFP image as the optimum sparse combination of the dictionary elements, which are generated by orthogonal matching pursuit. This not only separates the Gaussian noise from the target DoFP image with a significantly elevated peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) but also well-preserves ythe details of the original image. According to our extensive experimental results on various test images, the proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art principal component analysis based denoising algorithm by 3 dB in terms of PSNR. Moreover, visual comparison results, which show excellent agreement with the PSNR results, are presented as well.

AB  - The trace ratio optimization problem consists of maximizing a ratio between two trace operators and often appears in dimensionality reduction problems for denoising or discriminant analysis. In this paper, we propose a distributed and adaptive algorithm to solve the trace ratio optimization problem over network-wide covariance matrices, which capture the spatial correlation across sensors in a wireless sensor network. We focus on fully-connected network topologies, in which case the distributed algorithm reduces the communication bottleneck by only sharing a compressed version of the observed signals at each given node. Despite this compression, the algorithm can be shown to converge to the maximal trace ratio as if all nodes would have access to all signals in the network. We provide simulation results to demonstrate the convergence and optimality properties of the proposed algorithm.

AB  - Acoustic sensor networks (ASNs) are an effective solution to implement active noise control (ANC) systems by using distributed adaptive algorithms. On one hand, ASNs provide scalable systems where the signal processing load is distributed among the network nodes. On the other hand, their noise reduction performance is comparable to that of their respective centralized processing systems. In this sense, the distributed multiple error filtered-x least mean squares (DMEFxLMS) adaptive algorithm has shown to obtain the same performance than its centralized counterpart as long as there are no communications constraints in the underlying ASN. Regarding affine projection (AP) adaptive algorithms, some distributed approaches that are approximated versions of the multichannel filtered-x affine projection (MFxAP) algorithm have been previously proposed. These AP algorithms can efficiently share the processing load among the nodes, but at the expense of worsening their convergence properties. In this paper we develop the exact distributed multichannel filtered-x AP (EFxAP) algorithm, which obtains the same solution as that of the MFxAP algorithm as long as there are no communications constraints in the underlying ASN. In the EFxAP algorithm each node can compute a part or the entire inverse matrix needed by the centralized MFxAP algorithm. Thus, we propose three different strategies that obtain significant computational saving: 1) Gauss Elimination, 2) block LU factorization, and 3) matrix inversion lemma. As a result, each node computes only between 25% - 60% of the number of multiplications required by the direct inversion of the matrix. Regarding the performance in transient and steady states, the EFxAP exhibits the fastest convergence and the highest noise level reduction for any size of the acoustic network and any projection order of the AP algorithm compared to the DMEFxLMS and two previously reported distributed AP algorithms.

AB  - The center of temperature measured in the Fiber Bragg Grating temperature sensor produces a shift in the Bragg wavelength. There are a wide variety of algorithms used to detect this shift. However, these algorithms are highly affected by the noise generated in the sensor system. In recent years, many techniques have emerged that suppress this noise. Of these, wavelet noise reduction stands out as a popular technique. When the literature is reviewed, it is stated that this popular approach is superior to traditional methods. Contrary to what is said in the literature, this study proves that without the need for complex wavelet system or even curve fitting, it leads us to the same results and sometimes even better than traditional filtering. The hybrid approach proposed here is based on the traditional Fourier Filtering technique and the maximum method, which is a direct method in determining the central wavelength. In the error analysis, it is seen that the hybrid algorithm based on Fourier Filtering, which is the traditional filtering technique, gives the smallest relative error when compared with the real value.

The combined method realizes the extraction of useful signals with slowly changing speed by multi-resolution analysis of signals containing Gauss white noise. Compared with traditional processing methods, the wavelet threshold denoising algorithm has higher SNR and smaller mean square error (MSE) and has better processing effect and imaging effect.

AB  - The traditional Fourier algorithm cannot fix the problem of non-stationary noise deduction for MEMS-IMU, therefore this article uses Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) algorithm to denoise the signal. In this article, Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is combined to reduce the influence of end effect in the decomposition. First, the MEMS-IMU simulate signal generated by matlab is taken as the test object, and EMD as well as ELM extension decomposition are carried out for it respectively. The decomposition noise reduction effect is compared and analyzed to study the role of EMD and ELM in the process. Second, carry out a test on the authentically measured MEMS-IMU signal. In de-noising the MEMS-IMU simulate signal and authentic signal, we can analyze the noise deduction effect and observe the changes of parameters related to random error. The results show that the method based on ELM and EMD can achieve good noise reduction effect for MEMS signal.

AB  - A new approach to the problem of dimensionality reduction is proposed. The specific application is to the detection of signals in noise, although it should be applicable to other signal processing problems of current interest. Using a minimum mean square error estimator of the likelihood ratio one can determine a low dimensional statistic, not necessarily linear in the data, that performs well for detection, i.e., with minimal loss of information. If a sufficient statistic does exist for the problem then the proposed approach yields the well known result that one should use the likelihood ratio of the sufficient statistic for detection. Other interesting relationships are explored and some specific examples are given.

AB  - As ESC is widely used in daily life, it has developed rapidly in recent years. Environment sound classification is a type of sound event recognition (SER). Because of the different position between the sound source and the physical medium of collecting information and the interference of many other sound sources in the process of receiving sound, it leads to the confusion and overlapping of sound events and other complex environmental sound. Combined with the characteristics of environmental sound mentioned above, neural network training with typical experience risk minimization is prone to memory of specific individual voice in the training stage, which will lead to unsatisfactory prediction results when predicting data outside the training distribution, that is, the occurrence of over-fitting. In order to solve the problem of low generalization of neural network, this paper started from the data source to explore the effect of adding gaussian white noise and SNR noise into environmental sound, which are two kinds of audio enhancement algorithms, and organized a series of experiments on Urbansoud8K public environmental sound dataset to verify.

AB  - To improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of vibration location information in Φ-OTDR system, a variable step size normalized least mean square (VSS-NLMS) denoising method is proposed in the article. First, the mathematical principle of VSS-NLMS method is established. The method can adaptively filter the input signal and adjust the parameters. It can also update the step factor adaptively. The simulation results show that the SNR of this method is improved from -1.16 dB to 12.01 dB. Second, a heterodyne coherent optical system is built. After the detected beat signal is demodulated by I/Q quadrature demodulation, the amplitude signal and phase signal of the Rayleigh backscattered light are acquired. The amplitude signal determines the location information and the phase signal determines the vibration signal. Finally, the wavelet denoising method, the empirical mode decomposition soft threshold (EMD-soft) denoising method and the variational mode decomposition nonlinear wavelet threshold (VMD-NWT) denoising method are compared with the VSS-NLMS denoising method in the experiment. The experimental results show that the location information SNR of the VSS-NLMS denoising method is improved to 59.31 dB, 46.81 dB, 50.14 dB, 34.00 dB and 67.09 dB for 5 groups of 100 Hz - 500 Hz vibration events at the location of the 10.14 km sensing fiber. At the same time, the vibration signals of 5 groups are demodulated. This method has laid a foundation for the application of oil and gas pipelines.

AB  - In this paper, an interrogation method for a fiber-optic distributed disturbance sensor based on φ-optical time reflectometry to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for far-end disturbance is proposed. The wavelet de-noising based on simulated annealing algorithm with an adaptive threshold is utilized to smooth the noises and recover the signal. Then, the 2-D edge detection is employed to detect and locate multiple disturbances, simultaneously by calculating the spatial gradient of the grey image of the Rayleigh backscattering traces. This method is validated in a long-term field test, and three different disturbance events are detected and located along a 25.05-km-long sensing fiber, simultaneously. Experimental results show that the proposed method can reduce the gain imbalance between the front end and far end due to the attenuation of Rayleigh backscattered light, which means that it is effective to improve the SNR of far-end disturbance and recognize the location of disturbance in a harsh environment with strong background noises.

AB  - Radiation exposure in CT imaging leads to increased patient risk. This motivates the pursuit of reduced-dose scanning protocols, in which noise reduction processing is indispensable to warrant clinically acceptable image quality. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have received significant attention as an alternative for conventional noise reduction and are able to achieve state-of-the art results. However, the internal signal processing in such networks is often unknown, leading to sub-optimal network architectures. The need for better signal preservation and more transparency motivates the use of Wavelet Shrinkage Networks (WSNs), in which the Encoding-Decoding (ED) path is the fixed wavelet frame known as Overcomplete Haar Wavelet Transform (OHWT) and the noise reduction stage is data-driven. In this work, we considerably extend the WSN framework by focusing on three main improvements. First, we simplify the computation of the OHWT that can be easily reproduced. Second, we update the architecture of the shrinkage stage by further incorporating knowledge of conventional wavelet shrinkage methods. Finally, we extensively test its performance and generalization, by comparing it with the RED and FBPConvNet CNNs. Our results show that the proposed architecture achieves similar performance to the reference in terms of MSSIM (0.667, 0.662 and 0.657 for DHSN2, FBPConvNet and RED, respectively) and achieves excellent quality when visualizing patches of clinically important structures. Furthermore, we demonstrate the enhanced generalization and further advantages of the signal flow, by showing two additional potential applications, in which the new DHSN2 is used as regularizer: (1) iterative reconstruction and (2) ground-truth free training of the proposed noise reduction architecture. The presented results prove that the tight integration of signal processing and deep learning leads to simpler models with improved generalization.

AB  - Vibroarthrographic (VAG) signals are sounds or vibrations caused when a knee joint is flexed or stretched. VAG signal collection is noninvasive and can be performed using an accelerometer or microphone attached to the skin. However, the sensor attached to the skin will move with the soft tissue caused by flexion and extension, causing the baseline of the VAG signal to drift. We call these interferences soft tissue movement artifacts (STMAs). In this study, an algorithm is proposed to filter out STMAs. We compare the proposed method's results with noises collected by an accelerometer. The noise reduction effect is evaluated, revealing an 11.85% increase in the peak signal-to-noise ratio and a 28.18% increase in signal-to-noise ratio compared with the case in which STMA noise was not removed.

AB  - We propose a denoising method of multimodal graph signals with twofold smoothness regularization. Graph signal processing assumes that a signal has an underlying structure that is represented by a graph. In each node of the graph, we often have multimodal data or features that are correlated across modalities. Since these multimodal data are measured by various sensors, the observed data will be noisy. In this paper, we assume that a multimodal signal is smooth on two underlying graphs: One is a spatial graph (i.e., relationship among nodes) and the other is a modality graph (i.e., relationship among modalities). We formulate a regularized minimization problem based on smoothness on the twofold graphs. The problem is solved with an alternating minimization scheme. To avoid a hand-crafted parameter tuning that is usually costly and converges to local minima, we utilize deep algorithm unrolling (DAU) to train the parameters in the algorithm. To validate the proposed method, we conduct experiments on synthetic data and demonstrate that our method outperforms various existing graph signal denoising methods.

AB  - Fusing data from multiple sensors can improve performance beyond that of any individual sensor and at worst is limited to the best individual performance among the sensors. In this work, nominally identical RF sensors are spaced closely enough such that they receive equivalent signals. However, the sensors have independent variable front-end attenuations and thermal noise. If all pair-wise cross-correlations of signals among the sensors are averaged, a proper choice of attenuation settings can optimize the linearity of the result as measured by signal to distortion and noise (SINAD) ratio. With the receiver gain and 1dB compression point (IP1) as variables, a closed-form expression for the optimal attenuation settings is derived for two sensors and is extended for any number of coherent sensors with phase-aligned reception. The expression is verified with experimental measurements up to four sensors. However, in reality, the sensors measure differing signal powers, which violates the original assumptions of the derivation. Nonetheless, the derived result is robust to slight variations since the measured SINAD is within 1dB of the optimum as long as the difference in measured signal power between two sensors is less than 5dB. For the cases in which the measured signal powers differ by more than 5dB, this work presents an algorithm to adjust the attenuation values and the number of signal captures to compensate the loss in linearity. All results are corroborated with experimental measurements taken with four low-cost RadioHound sensors.

AB  - A denoising method based on singular value decomposition (SVD) with particle swarm optimization (PSO) is proposed to improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of far-end disturbances in distributed sensor system based on phase-sensitive optical time-domain reflectometry ( $\Phi $ -OTDR). Also, an improved clustering algorithm is introduced to locate the position of disturbance. The effective sensing distance of the  $\Phi $ -OTDR system is 25.05 km and four kinds of disturbance events, including watering, knocking, climbing and pressing, are applied on the sensing fiber respectively. A series of experiments of single-point far-end disturbances and five-point disturbances are carried out. Experimental results demonstrate that the SNR of far-end disturbance can be effectively improved to over 12dB, the processing time is less than 3 seconds, and the average location accuracy rate is more than 96%. Compared with the commonly used denoising methods, such as empirical mode decomposition (EMD), wavelet-1D and wavelet-2D, the SVD denoising with PSO method has better performance in SNR enhancement and real-time, which is beneficial for accurate positioning.

AB  - This study designs a low-power photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor based on the error compensation method for heartbeat interval acquisition. To perform heartbeat monitoring in daily life, it is necessary to obtain long-term and accurate heartbeat interval data with low power consumption, because of the limited size and battery capacity of the PPG sensor. Effective reduction in the power consumption of the sensor requires the duty-cycled LEDs and lowering pulse repetition frequency (PRF), i.e., decreasing the sampling rate. However, these methods reduce the accuracy of the heartbeat interval measurement because of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) degradation and sampling errors. We propose an algorithm for heartbeat interval error compensation and incorporate a low-noise readout circuit to improve SNR. The readout circuit uses current integration to achieve low duty-cycle LED driving. A correlated double sampling (CDS) is introduced to minimize the random noise arising from the switching operation of the integration circuit. An error compensation method based on the PPG waveform similarity is also introduced using the autocorrelation and linear interpolation. The measurement results obtained from nine subjects show that a total current consumption of 28.2 μA is achieved with a 20-Hz PRF and 0.3% LED duty cycle. The proposed design effectively reduces the mean absolute error (MAE) of the heartbeat interval to an average of 6.2 ms.

AB  - Modern binaural hearing aids (HAs) can collaborate wirelessly with each other as well as with other assistive (wireless) devices. This enables multi-microphone noise reduction over small wireless acoustic sensor networks (WASNs) to increase the intelligibility under adverse conditions. In this work, we assume one of the HAs to serve as the fusion center (FC). The optimal beamforming strategy for processing the received data at the FC depends on the acoustic scene and physical constraints (e.g., the bit-rate for transmission to the FC), and might be frequency dependent. Selection of the optimal beamforming strategy, while satisfying rate constraints on the communication between the different devices is an important challenge in such setups. In this paper, we propose an operational rate-constrained beamforming system for optimal rate allocation and strategy selection across frequency. We show an example of the proposed framework, where both the algorithm selection as well as the required rates to transmit the necessary microphone signals are optimized using uniform quantizers, while minimizing the mean-square error (MSE) distortion measure. In contrast to a well-known (theoretically optimal) reference method based on remote source coding for two devices, the presented algorithm is practically implementable and only requires knowledge of joint signal statistics at the FC. Evaluations (based on simulation experiments) show clear improvement over other practically implementable strateuies.

AB  - Graph signal processing is a ubiquitous task in many applications such as sensor, social, transportation and brain networks, point cloud processing, and graph neural networks. Often, graph signals are corrupted in the sensing process, thus requiring restoration. In this paper, we propose two graph signal restoration methods based on deep algorithm unrolling (DAU). First, we present a graph signal denoiser by unrolling iterations of the alternating direction method of multiplier (ADMM). We then suggest a general restoration method for linear degradation by unrolling iterations of Plug-and-Play ADMM (PnP-ADMM). In the second approach, the unrolled ADMM-based denoiser is incorporated as a submodule, leading to a nested DAU structure. The parameters in the proposed denoising/restoration methods are trainable in an end-to-end manner. Our approach is interpretable and keeps the number of parameters small since we only tune graph-independent regularization parameters. We overcome two main challenges in existing graph signal restoration methods: 1) limited performance of convex optimization algorithms due to fixed parameters which are often determined manually. 2) large number of parameters of graph neural networks that result in difficulty of training. Several experiments for graph signal denoising and interpolation are performed on synthetic and real-world data. The proposed methods show performance improvements over several existing techniques in terms of root mean squared error in both tasks.

AB  - In a distributed algorithm several processing nodes communicate with each other and incorporate in order to reach a common goal. Each unit has its own locally-observed environment while it can either help or mislead other units when sharing its information. This could be either intentional or simply due to the observation noise. Previous works mainly focus on locating the agents properly and assigning weights based on stationary environment in order to minimize the impact of noisy nodes. We, however, propose a method capable of assigning combination weights in accordance with momentary performance of the neighboring nodes. In order to demonstrate this capability, the proposed algorithm has been applied to well-known diffusion LMS algorithms. Unlike uniform weighting policy, the proposed method is robust to changes caused by malfunctioning nodes.

AB  - This letter presents an algorithm for reducing measurement uncertainty of one physical quantity when oversampling measurements of two physical quantities with correlated noise. The algorithm assumes that the aleatoric measurement uncertainty in both physical quantities follows a Gaussian distribution and relies on sampling faster than it is possible for the measurand (the true value of the physical quantity that we are trying to measure) to change (due to the system thermal time constant) to calculate the parameters of the noise distribution. In contrast to the Kalman and particle filters, which, respectively, require state update equations and a map of one physical quality, our algorithm requires only the oversampled sensor measurements. When applied to temperature-compensated humidity sensors, it provides reduced uncertainty in humidity estimates from correlated temperature and humidity measurements. In an experimental evaluation, the algorithm achieves average uncertainty reduction of 10.3%. The algorithm incurs an execution time overhead of 5.3% when compared to the minimum algorithm required to measure and calculate the uncertainty. Detailed instruction-level emulation of a C-language implementation compiled to the RISC-V architecture shows that the uncertainty reduction program required 0.05% more instructions per iteration than the minimum operations required to calculate the uncertainty.

AB  - A CO sensor based on photoacoustic spectroscopy (PAS) with empirical mode decomposition (EMD) algorithm is investigated and demonstrated in this paper. In the PAS system, the complicated photo-thermal-acoustic conversion is a nonlinear and non-stationary process and contains various noise. In order to compensate the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the EMD is introduced in the PAS system to deal with the photoacoustic signal. The experimental results show that a gain factor of ∼3.0 on the SNR is achieved and the sensor has an excellent linear response to the gas concentration. The minimum detection level (MDL) for CO detection is reduced to 1.14 ppm with a 300 ms integrated time at room temperature and atmospheric pressure.

AB  - In this paper, two modified FxLMS algorithms are proposed based on the post-masking-based LMS (PMLMS) algorithm. They are the PMl-FxLMS and the signed PMl-FxLMS (SPMl-FxLMS) algorithms. In both algorithms, l denotes the length of the error signal memory. The control filter coefficients are updated by the maximum absolute value in the error signal memory, instead of the immediate value. The difference between the two modified FxLMS algorithms is that the PMl-FxLMS algorithm keeps the sign of the error sample with the largest absolute value, while the SPMl-FxLMS algorithm uses the sign of the immediate error sample. The simulation results show that the SPMl-FxLMS algorithm converges faster than the standard FxLMS algorithm with the same step-size, and the PMl-FxLMS algorithm may be difficult to converge when l is large.

AB  - Power usage is an important aspect of wireless acoustic sensor networks (WASNs) and reducing the amount of information that is to be transmitted is one effective way to save it. In previous contributions, we presented sensor selection as well as rate distribution methods to reduce the power usage of beamforming algorithms in WASNs. Taking only transmission power into account, it was shown that rate distribution is a generalization of sensor selection and that rate distribution is more efficient than sensor selection with respect to the power usage versus performance trade-off. However, this excludes the energy consumption that it takes to keep the WASN nodes activated. In this paper, we present a more detailed comparison between sensor selection and rate-allocation by taking also into account the power to keep sensors activated for centralized WASNs. The framework is formulated by minimizing the total power usage, while lower bounding the noise reduction performance. Numerical results show that whether rate distribution is more efficient than sensor selection depends on the actual power that is used to keep sensors activated.

AB  - To reduce all kinds of noise interference in the transient electromagnetic signal, and improve the resolution of abnormal resistance in detection area. In this paper, a method based on Slime Mould Algorithm (SMA) optimized Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) combined with Wavelet Threshold Denoising (SMA-VMD-WTD) was proposed to identify and eliminate the noise. Firstly, the slime mould algorithm (SMA) was used to select the key parameters in VMD. Then, the signal was adaptively decomposed by VMD according to the optimized parameters to obtain certain modal components, and divided them into effective signal components and noise components. Finally, the effective signal components were further processed by Wavelet Threshold Denoising (WTD) and reconstructed to obtain the transient electromagnetic signal with noise removal. The simulation signal tests with different noise intensity were built, and this method was compared with Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD), WTD, unoptimized VMD and SMA to optimize VMD for reducing noise analysis of simulation tests. The results showed that SMA-VMD-WTD was more effective in identifying and eliminating transient electromagnetic signal noise. The method was applied to a geological exploration area, which verified the field applicability of this method. The results of the simulation tests and field test showed that SMA-VMD-WTD was a better denoising method for transient electromagnetic signal.

AB  - Various types of interference signals are available in the working environment of passive wireless surface acoustic wave (SAW) sensors. Among these kinds of interference, co-channel interference is difficult to suppress. To solve this problem, a SAW sensor anti-interference technology was proposed to improve the reliability of the SAW sensor. Wavelet denoising method was used to denoise SAW resonator (SAWR) response, which can maintain the envelope characteristics of the SAW response. The entropy energy model of the SAW response signal was established, and the signal envelope was extracted from the proposed entropy energy function. The waveform envelope and the entropy energy curve were adopted as the signal characteristics to form two-dimensional points. The K-Means algorithm was used to classify the two-dimensional points to distinguish the SAW response from sinusoidal interference. Simulation results showed that the SAW response can be detected with a rate of more than 85% when the signal-to-noise ratio was greater than 4 dB, whereas the false detection rate of the sinusoidal interference signal was less than 8%. Finally, the proposed algorithm was used to detect the actual SAW response and sinusoidal interference signal. The experimental results showed that the proposed method can clearly distinguish the SAW response from the co-channel interference signal. Moreover, the proposed method can be used as the anti-interference technology to improve the stability of the SAW sensor.

AB  - Ultra-wideband (UWB) technology is a potential candidate solution for Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) and Internet of Things (IoT) applications due to the advantages of high-speed communication and accurate positioning. Channel estimation plays a key role in UWB systems, especially in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) environments. In this paper, a noise-resistance channel estimation method based on compressed sensing is proposed for accurate estimation of UWB channels contaminated by noise. The proposed algorithm based on compressed sensing relies on the fact that the multipath signals of UWB have a sparse representation in the time domain or other domains. However, the reconstruction of multipath signals is difficult owing to the additive noise and noise-folding effect. In order to improve the noise robustness, UWB multipath signals are sparse representation by using the orthogonal basis of an eigen-based dictionary. Three approaches are applied to the proposed noise-resistance algorithm, including average pilot noise reduction, denoising whitening measurement, and sparsity adaptive matching pursuit (SAMP) algorithm. The improved relative residue is proposed to calculate the iteration termination condition of SAMP. Simulation results demonstrate that the algorithm provides good noise-resistance performances in terms of normalized mean square error (NMSE) of channel estimation and the bit error rate of Rake receivers, especially in low SNR environments.

AB  - The infrared sensing information often belongs to the weak signal in the detection system. In order to detect weak infrared sensing signal effectively, the paper designs a detection system scheme and detecting amplified circuit with the function of temperature compensation, and the detecting amplified circuit can effectively suppress the noise. Based on the above, a wavelet multi-scale and multi threshold processing algorithm of weak sensing information is proposed. In order to reduce the problem of signal distortion caused by general threshold de-noising, the paper uses an improved threshold function. In the de-noising process, the soft and hard threshold functions can be chosen flexibly by setting a constant. The experiment results show that the hardware and software signal processing and de-noising methods have good effect on the detection of weak infrared sensing signals.

AB  - Cardiac disease detection is a tedious process. Classification of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals plays an important role in the diagnosis of heart diseases. The most important factor that limits the detection of cardiac disease is the rare availability of instances of the abnormal condition collected using ECG sensors. And if the signals contain noise, then the classification might become a challenging task. In this work, we address the problem of cardiac disease detection when the dataset has less number of noisy ECG sensor signals. Here, Chebyshev Type II filter and Chebyshev function, which is termed as Chebfun, are used. The Chebyshev filter is used for high-frequency noise removal and Chebfun is used to approximate the signal with its coefficients. These coefficients known as Chebfun coefficients are used as the features. These features are used for classification. In the proposed work, machine learning algorithms, like SVM, logistic regression, decision tree, and AdaBoost, are used for classifying the features extracted from Chebfun.

AB  - Experimental Self-Mixing (SM) or optical feedback interferometric signals are usually affected by additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and impulsive noise. Depending on SM sensing set-up, these noises can significantly reduce the signal to noise ratio (SNR) of SM signals which in turn affects the measurement performance of signal processing algorithms employed for metric information retrieval. In this paper, adaptive line enhancement (ALE) technique is proposed to remove AWGN and impulsive noise from SM signals. Specifically, a recursive least squares (RLS) based ALE algorithm has been designed and the results have been compared with established methods such as high-order digital low-pass filtering and discrete wavelet transform. The comparison indicates better precision in case of use of RLS-ALE even when significant variations occur in the operating optical feedback regime and remote target velocity as well as in presence of speckle. The proposed algorithm can also estimate the SNR of SM signals belonging to weak-, moderate-, and strong-optical feedback regime with SNR ranging from 0 dB to 40 dB, with a mean absolute error of 1.35 dB and a 1.09 dB precision. Statistical analysis of noise recovered from different experimental SM signals attests the Gaussian- and impulsive-nature of noise. Thus, the proposed method also enables a simple and reliable quantitative analysis and comparison of different laser diode based SM laser sensors operating under variable optical conditions.

AB  - Active control of noise for multi-channel applications is affected by the existence of nonlinear primary and secondary paths. There is a degradation in the performance of linear multi-channel active noise control (LMANC) systems based on minimization of sum of squared errors obtained from multiple sensors in presence of nonlinear primary path (NPP) and nonlinear secondary path (NSP) conditions. The NPP and NSP problems are more prominent and challenging for multi-point noise control applications owing to different locations of silent zones and acoustic coupling between secondary sources and error sensors. In order to surmount this problem, an incremental strategy based nonlinear distributed ANC (NDANC) system is developed in this article. The adaptive exponential functional link network (AE-FLN) is employed as an adaptive control unit at the acoustic sensor nodes (ASNs) for the design of NDANC system. The incremental co-operation scheme is utilized to provide uniform noise cancellation in presence of NPP and NSP conditions. Simulation study is conducted extensively to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed system for different practical NPP and NSP scenarios. The detailed computational load analysis and subjective evaluation of reduction in perceptual noise levels are performed for different real noise conditions.

AB  - Fiber Bragg gratings (FBG) sensor has attracted considerable attention for structural health monitoring (SHM) in aerospace aluminum alloy structures in recent years. The experimental FBG signals used to detect flaws contains noise. Therefore, in this paper, an algorithm that combines variational mode decomposition (VMD) with discrete wavelet transform (DWT) was proposed to deal with the signal denoising problem. Then, it is a challenge problem for structural damage detection to extract the features that sensitive to damage and robust to noise from the FBG signal response. This paper presents several damage features extraction algorithms, such as the multi-peaks central wavelength algorithm, full width at half Maximum (FWHM) algorithm, the spectral difference algorithm and the spectral area algorithm. Then, the denoised structure signal can be used to test the damage features extraction algorithm effectiveness and for future damage detection.

AB  - The reconstruction of frequency-sparse signals from a low number of samples using a compressed sensing concept is a widely studied problem and solutions based on greedy and relaxation methods are available. However, their performance is degraded in presence of spectral leakage, which affects the sparsity of the signal representation and consequently, its estimation accuracy. In this paper a two-stage optimization approach, called Opti2, is proposed for the reconstruction of periodic signals that can be expressed in terms of fundamental frequency and harmonics. The estimation provided by basis pursuit denoising (BPDN) sparse optimization approach is computed in the first stage and used as initial guess for the second stage, where a constrained non-linear optimization problem is solved in an iterative fashion, aiming to improve the estimation of the signal parameters. The evaluation of the proposed method with simulated and experimental data demonstrates that it outperforms existing approaches in term of accuracy, showing its robustness to noise, compression rate and dictionary refinement factor.

AB  - In India, several million tons of grain are stored in silos, warehouses, and gunny bags for future use. Temperature and grain moisture content are the most important factors responsible for the growth of mold, fungus, insects within the stored grain. If these factors are not monitored at early stages, contamination and insect infestation will damage all stored grain. In addition to these factors, CO2 evolution is also taken as a measure to detect deterioration in grain. The sensor network is a prominent technique through which environmental factors can be monitored. Although, this technique faces issues such as constraints of devices like limited energy, computational capability, and data storage. To overcome such issues, this paper proposes an architecture and methodology for monitoring temperature, moisture content, and CO2 concentration for granary called as Software-Defined Wireless Sensor Network. Data aggregation and data smoothing algorithms has proposed to reduce energy consumption by a node and to reduce noise. To predict the quality of stored grain, machine learning algorithms such as K-Nearest Neighbor, Random Forest, and Linear Regression has implemented at controller in control plane. Results show that Random Forest performs better and correctly predicted the quality of grain with the highest accuracy among all classifiers.

The PD ultrasonic array detection is affected by field noise and traditional PD direction algorithms generally face various problems such as low precision and a complex computational process. Considering this, we proposed a PD ultrasonic array detection method based on the de-noising method in spare decomposition theory and the reduced dimension multiple signal classification (RD-MUSIC) algorithm. Firstly, the matching pursuit (MP) algorithm in spare decomposition theory is improved to conduct simulations of PD signals; secondly, direction-finding is simulated for PD signals by using the RDMUSIC algorithm. Finally, the experimental data are subjected to de-noising and direction-finding by using spare decomposition theory and the RD-MUSIC algorithm after conducting an experimental study under laboratory conditions. Moreover, a comparison is made between the location results after, and before, de-noising to verify that the method is practicable.

AB  - Significant benefits can be achieved through the integration of cognitive computing technologies in healthcare delivery services, including physiotherapy. The traditional approach to physiotherapy requires attaching a marker-based tracking device with the patients and conducting analysis to diagnose by physiotherapists and chiropractors. Tracking efficiency of patient rehabilitation frequently depends on the physiotherapist's notes, which is tedious and prone to errors. In order to streamline the process of data collection and record-keeping, and to make more informed decisions on the effectiveness of prescribed therapy, depth sensors can be integrated with current physician practices. This paper is one of the very first attempts to assist physicians through proprietary Kinect sensor-based technologies. The goal is to make sure static posture estimation is highly accurate. Thus, this paper introduces the solution through a noise reduction framework where the Kalman filter and a recursive noise reduction algorithm are combined to improve the accuracy and the consistency of the human 3D skeleton motion data. The Kalman filter is used for the reduction of tremors by abnormal estimation of body joints in real-time using Kinect v2. The posture correction algorithm is incorporated in the proposed framework to reduce anthropometrically inconsistent estimation of limb lengths of the human body. The proposed posture correction algorithm was extensively validated on the proprietary data set.

AB  - In this paper, we present a hybrid denoising algorithm for division-of-focal-plane (DoFP) polarization image sensors, which is based on Block-Matching and 3D Filtering (BM3D) and K-times Singular Value Decomposition (KSVD) denoising algorithms. The proposed algorithm employs the KSVD denoising algorithm to improve the “First Estimate” image in BM3D algorithm, which dictates the second round of grouping. In addition to improving the second round of grouping, the proposed algorithm improves the final denoised image through proper matching of the two algorithms which also helps to preserve key image details. Extensive experimental results on DoFP images show that the proposed algorithm outperforms a vast selection of existing denoising algorithms for DoFP polarization images including the state-of-the-art BM3D denoising algorithm visually as well as numerically in terms of Peak-Signal-to-Noise-Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity (SSIM) Index.

AB  - Localization is considered as a tough, complicated and important problem in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) due to challenges related to energy consumption, coverage and connectivity. Received Signal Strength (RSSI) is one of the most important techniques to measure nodes position. It is based on the use of the path loss model of the radio frequency propagation. This makes the RSSI based technique vulnerable to fading and shadowing problem, multipathing and environmental effects. To reduce the impact of those problems a filtering model related to signal attenuation is proposed. It implements the feedback filter to reduce noise during signal transmission with consideration of earlier values of received signal strength. This enables to predict possible values of the RSSI and thus the position of nodes. To improve the localization accuracy, hardware characteristics are introduced in the filtering model. The proposed model explore the multiplication and summation errors of the node. Real experiments are carried out on the panStamp sensor node at two different temperatures. The new proposed RSSI technique shows a reduced localization error compared to the simple RSSI method.

AB  - A novel de-noising method based on the compressive sensing reconstruction algorithm is proposed in this paper, which is used to solve the problem that the fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensing signal is easily affected by environment interference. By analyzing the characteristics of the FBG signal in the sparse domain, we calculated the sparsity of the FBG signal through the exponential fitting method. Considering the complexity of the traditional algorithm, we proposed a reasonable threshold for selecting multi-atom to reduce the run time of the reconstruction algorithm. In addition, we designed the elimination strategy and double termination conditions to improve the precision of the reconstructed signal. The experiment results show that the maximum reconstructed signal-to-noise ratio of our method is 49.2 dB, with a relative error of 0.0034~0.0074. The run time of the proposed algorithm is much lower than the same-type algorithms. The reconstruction precision is far beyond the wavelet threshold de-noising and empirical mode decomposition.

AB  - Collaborative beamforming (CBF) is a promising technique aimed at improving energy efficiency of communication in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) which has attracted considerable attention in the research community recently. It is based on a fact that beampattern with stable mainlobe can be formed, if multiple sensors synchronize their oscillators and jointly transmit a common message signal. In this paper, we consider application of CBF with one bit of feedback in different communication scenarios and analyze the impact of constraints imposed by simple sensor node hardware, on the resulting signal strength. First, we present a CBF scheme capable of reducing interference levels in the nearby WSN clusters by employing joint feedback from multiple base stations that surround the WSN of interest. Then, we present a collaborative power allocation and sensor selection algorithm, capable of achieving beamforming gains with transmitters that are not able to adjust their oscillators' signal phase. The performance of the algorithms is assessed by means of achieved beamforming gain which is given as a function of algorithm iterations. The presented results, which are based on numerical simulations and mathematical analysis, are compared with the ideal case without constraints and with negligible noise at the Base Station (BS).

AB  - The virtual sensing technique allows the active noise control (ANC) system to work with error microphones that are placed far from the desired zone of quietness (ZoQ). Conventionally, a training stage is required to obtain the auxiliary filters with the temporary error microphones placed in the ZoQ. When the characteristics of the primary noise changes, the auxiliary filters have to be retrained. As a result, the conventional virtual sensing technique can only be used when the frequency band of the primary noise remains unchanged. In order to solve this limitation, this paper proposes a selective virtual sensing technique for the multi-channel feedforward ANC system. The selective virtual sensing technique obtains a bank of auxiliary filters in the subband structure. Based on the frequency-band-matching mechanism, a linear combination of the auxiliary filters is calculated and used in the real-time control stage. Experimental results show that the selective virtual sensing technique achieves better noise reduction performance than the conventional virtual sensing technique when the frequency band of the primary noise fluctuates.

AB  - The rank-reduction (RARE) algorithm is a well-known class of algorithms for direction of arrival (DOA) es-timation in the presence of imperfect array manifolds. Since the spectral peak search is inevitable for the current RARE algorithm, it may bring a huge occupational load for practical implementations. In order to reduce the computational com-plexity, in this paper, we propose a root-RARE algorithm for DOA estimation with partly calibrated uniform linear arrays (ULAs). Through replacing the spectral peak search with a polynomial root finding, our proposed method can get much higher efficiency than the original RARE method. Simulation results demonstrate that our method can significantly reduce the computational complexity and improve the DOA estimation performance in a low SNR case.

AB  - Most smartphones are dual microphone devices capable of determining the direction of arrival of an utterance from a speaker source. The widespread use of such devices helps in improving hearing aid systems without increased expenses. These types of sound source localization (SSL) systems with two sensors take advantage of time delay estimation (TDE) techniques such as cross-correlation and adaptive eigenvalue decomposition (AED). The former lacks reliability in situations with reverb, while the latter suffers from background noise. In this paper, we observed the effect of integrating a noise reduction algorithm to AED for SSL applications. Given the robustness of AED with room reverb, we expect performance improvement of TDE from noise-reduced outputs. The minimum mean-square error with decision-directed (MMSE-DD) noise estimation algorithm acts as a filter for the received signals. We proposed $\text{MMSE}-\text{DD}+\text{AED}$ to obtain an SSL algorithm in poor environment conditions. The empirical results of the system yielded 69.87%, which is a significant improvement from previous SSL algorithms in smartphones. Furthermore, a tilt compensation solution boosted the accuracy to 79.28%, addressing the dynamic behavior of the built-in microphones of the device.

AB  - Target signal detection in the presence of tow-ship noise is an important requirement in towed array sonar applications. The self-interference is a severe problem especially in the ocean conditions where multipath propagation is supported. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning-based algorithm using deep regression neural network (DRNN) for effective self-noise suppression with minimal power loss for target signal. In the training phase, the designed DRNN tries to minimize the root mean square error between the received signal and the desired output which is the target alone signal. In the testing phase, the DRNN is fed with the received signal and the neural network learns to suppress the self-noise caused by the tow ship. Due to the self-learning ability and high feature extraction capability, the network performs extremely well. To the best of our knowledge, deep learning-based algorithm is employed for the first time, for tow-ship noise suppression application, as per literature. The efficacy of the proposed method is evaluated over simulated data and the simulations were done as received by a towed linear array of acoustic sensors in the shallow ocean scenario. Experimental results show that the proposed method can improve the accuracy significantly.

AB  - In this paper, we propose an energy-efficient multihop transmission technique for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) based on Dijkstra algorithm. We consider a WSN composed of N sensor nodes. Firstly, we group the sensor nodes into clusters according to their placement in the monitoring area, then we organize the nodes within each cluster by electing the appropriate node as cluster head and classifying the remaining nodes into active nodes and sleeping nodes. Then, we select the set of reliable relays which cooperate to forward data with the least transmit power. Our proposed relay selection algorithm is based on Dijkstra algorithm. The main contribution of the paper is to define a new transmission strategy that improves the results of our previous work proposed in [?] by better minimizing power consumption. Therefore, the proposed transmission technique can improve significantly the reduction of power consumption compared to the previous transmission technique. Simulations results prove that the new transmission technique based on Dijkstra algorithm increases the energy savings to prolong the network lifetime.

AB  - Nowadays, blade tip timing (BTT) is becoming an effective and promising method in blade vibration monitoring. However, blade tip-timing signals are usually disturbed by strong noises in the actual production. How to extract the tip-timing signals accurately from noising signals is still a challenge. In this paper, a novel blade tip-timing signals extracting method is proposed. The method consists of two key steps. First, a denoising algorithm and the multi-scale filters based on EEMD for blade tip-timing signals is designed. The noisy signals are decomposed into several intrinsic modes and a residue from high frequency to low frequency, and denoising signals are reconstructed by using different filters. Second, a square-wave shaping algorithm is proposed to extract the standard unit pulse signals from denoising signals. The approximation index and relevance index are set as a judgment criterion of algorithms. The numerical simulation noisy signals and the real measurement signals are tested to validate the feasibility of the proposed method. Compared with the traditional calibration method, the proposed mothed has a higher precision and a lower error.

AB  - The signal processing method based on extremal filtration in low signal-to-noise ratio conditions was proposed. The extremal filtration is similar to the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) method, but complex mathematical calculations are absent that is the main advantage. Using it in real measuring devices significantly increases the speed rate. The extremal filtration process is an algorithm that involves sequentially repeating until an optimal result. The disadvantage of this method is decreasing the spatial resolution since every iteration due to a reduction in the number of samples. It is an especially negative fact in areas of sharp signal change. This paper demonstrates how to solve this problem using linear interpolation and to improve the result obtained by simple extremal filtration.

AB  - Johnson-Nyquist noise is the electronic noise generated by the thermal agitation of charge carriers, which increases when the sensor overheats. Current high-speed cameras used in low-light conditions are often cooled down to reduce thermal noise and increase their signal to noise ratio. These sensors, however, record hundreds of frames per second, which takes time, requires energy, and heavy computing power due to the substantial data load. Event-based sensors benefit from a high temporal resolution and record the information in a sparse manner. Based on an asynchronous time-based image sensor, we developed another version of this event-based camera whose pixels were designed for low-light applications and added a Peltier-effect-based cooling system at the back of the sensor in order to reduce thermal noise. We show the benefits from thermal noise reduction and study the improvement of the signal to noise ratio in the estimation of event-based normal flow norm and angle and particle tracking in microscopy.

AB  - Heart rate (HR) monitoring using photoplethysmographic (PPG) signals recorded from wearers' wrist greatly facilitates design of wearable devices and maximizes user experience. However, placing PPG sensors in wrist causes much stronger and complicated motion artifacts (MA) due to loose interface between sensors and skin. Therefore, developing robust HR estimation algorithms for wrist-type PPG signals has significant commercial values. In this paper, we propose a robust HR estimation algorithm for wrist-type PPG signals using multiple reference adaptive noise cancellation (ANC) technique-termed here as “MURAD.” The main challenge of using ANC for MA reduction is to devise a qualified reference noise signal (RNS) to the adaptive filter. We propose a novel solution by using four RNSs, namely, the three-axis accelerometer data and the difference signal between the two PPG signals. For each RNS, we get a different version of the cleaned PPG signal. Then, a set of probable HR values is estimated using all of the cleaned PPG signals, and then, the value that is closest to the estimated HR of the previous time window is chosen to be the HR estimate of the current window. Then, some peak verification techniques are employed to ensure accurate HR estimations. The proposed technique gives lower average absolute error compared to state-of-the art methods. So, MURAD method provides a promising solution to the challenge of HR monitoring using PPG in wearable devices during severe MA conditions.

AB  - Denoising is a crucial step in the localization of partial discharge (PD) in a substation. In this paper, a novel multi-resolution generalized S-transform (GST) denoising algorithm for precise localization of PD in substations is proposed. The algorithm denoises the PD signal received by the ultra-high frequency (UHF) sensor in two steps. First, the GST with the high frequency resolution is used to analyze the PD signal, and a GST filter is designed to filter out periodic narrowband noises. Then, the S-transform (a particular case of GST) is applied to analyze the PD signal, and the white Gaussian noise is suppressed according to the statistical characteristic difference between the noise and effective signal. Finally, the denoised PD signal is obtained and applied to PD localization. The simulations results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively suppress noise and can extract accurate time delay data from the denoised PD signal. The experiment results show that, compared with the wavelet transform, the localization error of the proposed algorithm is the smallest, which is 1.59m. The proposed algorithm can realize the precise localization of PD.

AB  - Adaptive filters are one of the most promising solutions to several signal enhancement problems in a non-stationary environment. However, depending on the characteristics of the signals and noise, the processing complexity and convergence speed for adaptive filters vary. Therefore, it is often preferred to apply adaptive filters in the transform domain to reduce complexity and increase convergence speed. In this paper, the application of the LMS (Least Mean Square) algorithm, which is the most preferred algorithm of adaptive filters in the field of speech noise cancellation, in the wavelet transform domain was studied. For this purpose, improving speech signals with different Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) using Wavelet Transform Domain LMS (WTD-LMS) algorithm in the proposed method was applied. The results obtained were evaluated with measures that are frequently used in speech enhancement applications. It is observed that the success of the proposed method outperforms adaptive and traditional methods for two sensor measurements are available.

Based on the feedforward structure and the filtered-x least mean square (FXLMS) algorithm, the proposed system cancels broadband noise without put an error sensor at desired location. Real time processing experiments show that the 1×2×2 feedforward ANC system with integration of virtual sensing technique achieves satisfactory performance for noise reduction. The zone of quiet (ZoQ) is measured to assure system performance.

AB  - There are many kinds of noises in optical fiber sensing signals. Environmental natural noise and attenuation noise are the two most widely existing noises. They directly affect the quality of optical fiber sensing vibration signal. This paper mainly deals with the attenuation noise in the vibration signal of optical fiber sensing. Firstly, a neural network with trapezoidal convolution kernel structure is constructed to enhance the amplitude of optical fiber sensing vibration signal. The network consists of up-down sampling network. The down-sampling network obtains the dimensional features by learning a specific mapping relationship. The up-sampling network obtains the enhanced signal directly from the features through the deconvolution network. Secondly, the parameters of the network are set and the network is trained. Finally, qualitative and quantitative experiments are used to evaluate the advantages of the proposed algorithm. The results show that the proposed algorithm has better amplitude enhancement effect than other algorithms.

AB  - In the past two decades, wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and their applications have been the topic of many studies. Different multi-sensor nodes are used to collect, process and distribute data over wireless links to perform different tasks such as smart detection, target tracking, node localization, etc. In this article, the problem of distributed adaptive estimation of node-specific signals for signal enhancement or noise reduction is addressed. First the centralized rank R generalized eigenvalue decomposition (GEVD) based multichannel Wiener filter (MWF) with prior knowledge for node-specific signal estimation in a WSN is introduced, where (some of) the nodes have partial prior knowledge of the desired sources steering matrix. A distributed adaptive estimation algorithm for a fully-connected WSN is then proposed demonstrating that this MWF can be obtained by letting the nodes work on compressed (i.e. reduced-dimensional) sensor signals compared to the centralized algorithm. The distributed algorithm can be used in applications such as speech enhancement in a wireless acoustic sensor network (WASN), where (some of) the nodes have prior knowledge on the location of the desired speech sources and on their local microphone array geometry or have access to clean noise reference signals. Foundations for a proof of convergence using a Lagrangian framework, are given, since convergence is observed in batch-mode simulations. Finally, numerical simulation results are provided for a speech enhancement scenario.

AB  - The sensor tuning of a proton precession magnetometer determines the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of induced free induction decay (FID) signal, while the quality of the FID influences the measurement accuracy of the geomagnetic field. Even though numerous methods have been proven to be effective in improving the tuning precision, how to efficiently decrease tuning error in a noisy environment is still a crucial challenge. To end this, a new tuning algorithm based on the combination of principal component analysis (PCA) and singular value decomposition (SVD), namely C-PCASVD, was presented in this paper. This novel algorithm aims to suppress the interference of the FID signal. The proposed C-PCASVD can obtain the dominant principal components of FID and noise, respectively. In addition, it is able to identify the corresponding singular values of interference, which could achieve an optimum trade-off between the denoised FID and noise reduction efficiency. The performance of the proposed method is tested on synthetic and field signals from different surveys. Good tuning frequency estimations are obtained at different SNRs. Through comparing the proposed C-PCASVD tuning algorithm with the state-of-the-art methods, including peak detection (PD), auto-correction and FFT (AC-FFT), and secondary tuning based on SVD (ST-SVD), the experimental results demonstrate that the C-PCASVD can significantly improve the tuning precision of proton precession magnetometer in a noisy environment.

AB  - Due to strong interchannel interference in multichannel active noise control (ANC), there are fundamental problems associated with the filter adaptation and online secondary path modeling remains a major challenge. This paper proposes a wave-domain adaptation algorithm for multichannel ANC with online secondary path modelling to cancel tonal noise over an extended region of two-dimensional plane in a reverberant room. The design is based on exploiting the diagonal-dominance property of the secondary path in the wave domain. The proposed wave-domain secondary path model is applicable to both concentric and nonconcentric circular loudspeakers and microphone array placement, and is also robust against array positioning errors. Normalized least mean squares-type algorithms are adopted for adaptive feedback control. Computational complexity is analyzed and compared with the conventional time-domain and frequency-domain multichannel ANCs. Through simulation-based verification in comparison with existing methods, the proposed algorithm demonstrates more efficient adaptation with low-level auxiliary noise.

AB  - The short-time diurnal variation magnetic noise is an important factor restricting the further improvement of the quality of airborne magnetic survey data. Since it is random and nonstationary, simple filtering methods cannot suppress it. Considering its characteristics of wide spatial distribution and strong spatial consistency, this paper proposes two adaptive filtering methods, Kalman filtering method and an improved normalized Least Mean Square (INLMS) adaptive filtering algorithm, to remove the diurnal variation magnetic noise measured by airborne magnetic sensors. These two methods can not only reduce in real time the influence of short-time diurnal variation magnetic noise by setting a reference magnetic sensor, but also avoid the influence of the outliers in the reference magnetic data. The actual experiments show that the two methods can effectively suppress the diurnal variation magnetic noise in airborne magnetic survey data, thereby improving the signal-noise ratio (SNR) of magnetic survey data and recovering the target magnetic signal well.

AB  - Recently, tensor-based multichannel noise reduction has been widely studied by many researchers. In this framework, researchers represent observed multichannel signals as a 3-dimensional tensor. Then, the tensor's multi-linear filtering theory is adopted to reduce spatially white or colored noise. The alternating least square approach is adopted and these algorithms generally need several iterations to converge. In this paper, we use the tensor decomposition theory and develop a supervised machine learning algorithm to obtain adaptive factoring matrices. The obtained matrices can transform the input noisy tensor into a sparse core tensor. Then, we reduce the noise by manipulating coefficients in the core tensor according to their amplitude. Specifically, we start from the minimum risk point of view and calculate an optimal threshold that kills the small entries and keep only the large entries in the core tensor. Our simulations show the proposed algorithm can significantly reduce spatially white noise and cause little distortion.

AB  - Physiological features extraction from Motion Artifacts (MA) corrupted Photoplethysmography (PPG) signals are of great difficulty due to the non-linear interaction between clean PPG and noise. To accurately extract features such as heart rate, blood pressure, and Oxygen Saturation in Blood, a robust PPG de-noising and waveform recovering method is required. However, traditional adaptive filtering or signal decomposition methods fail to achieve this goal. In this paper, a Signal-Noise Interaction modeling based algorithm for motion artifacts removal (SniMA) under strenuous physical exercise utilizing Envelope Filtering (EF) and Time-Delay Neural Network (TDNN) is proposed. Envelope Filtering normalizes raw data and eliminates imbalance training problem for neural networks, while TDNN is a hidden-state included method aiming at modeling PPG signal-noise interaction. An accelerometer as well as a gyroscope functions as the noise reference. Results comparing 8 performance indexes extracted from 4 types of waveform related features (heart rate, waveform correlation, pulse width, and pulse area) on an open access dataset we built show SniMA's effectiveness for PPG MA removal. The proposed algorithm provides a significant improvement in PPG waveform recovery and PPG feature estimation accuracy. This is the first time that a TDNN has been introduced for PPG de-noising. This study also indicates the potential of other hidden-state involved signal-noise interaction modeling methods for PPG de-noising.

AB  - Near-surface imaging with distributed sensor networks (DSN) is promising for planet exploration, which affordably generates a near-surface velocity model. Recently, an Eikonal tomography-based ambient noise seismic imaging (ANSI) algorithm was implemented in a DSN to realize real-time and in-situ near-surface imaging. However, only using data from neighbors to generate a velocity map cannot have enough stacking samples to generate high-quality results. Also, the neighbor range increase will result in the exponential rise of communication costs. To overcome this problem, we propose a new decentralized Eikonal tomography algorithm in the DSN. The main idea is to change the source-based algorithm to a receiver-based one, which we call common receiver decentralized Eikonal tomography (CR-TomoEK). With CR-TomoEK, nodes fully utilize signals from neighbors to generate partial velocity maps, when combined, lead to the final output. When compared with the original Eikonal algorithm, the stacking number is significantly increased, output quality is higher than before, and there is a significant reduction in communication cost. We performed experiments on both synthetic data and real data from the USArray Transportable Array. Both imaging quality and communication cost are considered in the algorithm validation. The result shows that our algorithm significantly increases the output quality while keeping the communication cost safe to generate a real-time result.

AB  - The performance of vehicle detection system is often affected by both internal and external noise. In this paper, a novel vehicle detection scheme called vehicle detector based on EMD-HT and multichannel GLRT (V-EHMG) is proposed, which composed of signal denoising part based on empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and signal detection part which takes advantage of the spatial–temporal relationship acquired by multiple sensors. In the first part, we propose a new denoising algorithm null-hypothesis interval threshold EMD denoising (EMD-HT) to check the similarity between the probability density function of the decomposed intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) from input signal and the generalized Gaussian distribution to determine relevant IMFs for signal reconstruction. Combined the interval threshold method, the denoised signals are acquired. In the second part, we use multichannel generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) detector to judge the presence of other vehicles with the denoised signals as the input. Simulation and physical experimental results show that with V-EHMG, the signal-to-noise ratio of the signal is doubled and the detection range is improved more than 40% compared with the traditional methods.

AB  - During the design of transducers placement for an active noise control system, current optimization methods need to predetermine the error sensors placement, which makes the secondary source placement dependent on the error sensors positions and increases the workload of joint optimization. In this study, a method free from the information of specific error sensors positions is proposed. Using plane wave decomposition, the prior knowledge of primary pressures and acoustic transfer impedances is transformed to corresponding plane waves, and the cost function for active noise control is formulated in wave-domain. Simulated experiments are conducted to evaluate the proposed method and compare it with two other traditional methods. Results show that the proposed method can optimize the secondary source placement effectively, and better global noise reduction can be achieved.

Five sensors were irradiated with high-energy photons to a variety of doses and analyzed with a wavelet-based signal reconstruction algorithm. The algorithm is explained in detail and the radiation effects on individual pixels are discussed. Finally, the production rate of RTS pixels as a function of dose is explored, providing information on the underlying defect structure responsible for this noise source.

AB  - To improve the accuracy of Brillouin time-domain reflection sensing signal to address precise strain and temperature sensing issues of overhead transmission lines or fibers, we propose a hybrid data noise reduction algorithm combining time series analysis with Kalman filter. The basic idea of the algorithm is to utilize the time series analysis theory to build a non-stationary model for compound strain and temperature variance rules, which can be considered as the state transition equation of Kalman filter. Secondly, we can obtain the observation equation of the Kalman filter via BOTDR technology measuring the strain and temperature of the sensing fiber. Then, the strain and temperature sensing and sampling data are processed by the recursive filtering of Kalman prediction. In a word, one can promptly and accurately locate or predict the icing and lightning strike on the overhead transmission lines or fibers with our proposed algorithm. According to the experimental results, the accuracy and rapid convergence of our algorithm is verified.

AB  - This paper presents a new speech enhancement method based on wavelet thresholds. Previously, we have proposed the forward blind source separation (FBSS) structure implemented in wavelet transform domain (WFBSS) to reduce acoustic noise components in a two-sensor configuration system. In the simulations results, The WFBSS algorithm has shown superiority in term of convergence speed in comparison with the FBSS algorithm. However, this algorithm has a heavy computational complexity. This problem may be reduced by applying a thresholding method. To achieve this objective, we propose, in this paper, a Two-channel threshold Wavelet-based forward blind source separation algorithm (TWFBSS) algorithm. Performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated on the estimated speech signal by several criteria in real conditions.

AB  - In order to eliminate the noise on the pulse interval of high-speed spike-based image sensor, a pulse interval compensation (PIC) algorithm is proposed. Based on the analysis of the principle of sensor noise generation, a pulse interval error model is constructed and the compensation algorithm is developed. First, raw pulse data is obtained from the sensor system, and then the coefficient matrix is used to compensate the non-uniform pulse interval caused by the dark current. Then, the guided filter separates high-frequency noise from scenes details and the pulse interval compensation matrix is obtained in the corresponding pulse interval. Finally, the pulse interval compensation is performed on the raw pulse data for correction. In static scene experiments, the proposed method is compared with the existing state-of-the-art methods and shows a clear advantage in denoising in both low texture and rich texture scenes. In the experiment to film a turntable at a rotation speed of 2000 r/min, 3000 r/min, 6000 r/min, the average roughness decreases from 0.2830 to 0.2034, 0.2937 to 0.2139 and 0.3252 to 0.2501 respectively. These experiments proved that the proposed method can effectively eliminate the noise of the spike-based image sensor.

AB  - In this paper, we propose a direction-finding algorithm for coherently distributed noncircular sources using two parallel linear arrays. First, we establish the relation between the generalized array manifolds of the two linear sub-arrays. Secondly, taking advantage of non-circularity properties of noncircular signal, we use the receiving data and it's conjugate to extend observation vector. Thirdly, the theory of rank reduction estimator (RARE) is used to estimate central direction of arrival (DOA) and non-circularity phase. The algorithm has good performance in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Moreover, the sensor arrays are extended to estimate more DOAs. Computer simulations are shown to verify the efficacy of the proposed algorithm. It can also estimate the 2D DOA independently of deterministic angular signal distribution function.

AB  - Eliminating noise from the original signal is still a demanding problem for researchers. There has been a number of published algorithms and each approach has its limitations, advantages, and constraints. Here we present our own contribution on the noise reduction problem by proposing an intermediary step between the image sensor and the post-processing software in the image capturing process. Our accelerated method, compared to other researchers, can be used either as a standalone solution or combined with an existing algorithm to further results improvement. Our solution matches the discrete samples between multiple frames and averages the pixel values. The output image maintains its structural integrity, holds better color accuracy and incurs less noise than others.

AB  - Due to their physical properties, nanomechanical sensors (NEMS) can achieve mass measurements in the mega- to gigadalton range, which is hardly obtained with conventional mass-spectrometers. However, NEMS signals are subject to noise, causing a loss of mass resolution and thus emphasizing the need of noise control. We propose a denoising model that relies on a total variation formulation, which deals with different noise models (particularly colored noise) affecting NEMS. The model also takes into account the physics of NEMS, such as the non-linear coupling between signals of individual NEMS. The performance of the proposed model is tested on simulated data which parameters are chosen similar to true experimental conditions. The obtained results confirm the interest of our model with a mass-resolution increase over 20% compared to methods used in literature.

AB  - Anisotropic diffusion (AD) is employed to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of Brillouin distributed optical fiber sensor. A Brillouin optical time-domain analyzer (BOTDA) with 99-km-long fiber under test is set up, where a section of 2.3 m and another 182 m section at the end of the fiber are heated for experimental verification. The SNR of experimental data sets with different sampling point numbers are enhanced to several improvement levels by AD and three other methods for comparison. Results show that the 2.3 m section and the temperature transition region of the 182 m section are better preserved by AD than other methods for the same SNR improvement. Objective criteria analysis shows that AD achieves the best measured spatial resolution and temperature accuracy among the four methods, the location of temperature transition can be detected more accurately for data with low SPNs after AD denoising. In addition, the processing time of AD is 1/3 that of non-local means (NLM) and 60/00 that of block-matching and 3D filtering (BM3D). The edge-preserving quality and fast processing speed allow the proposed algorithm to be a competitive denoising alternative for sensors based on Brillouin scattering.

AB  - Buried pipelines and cables are being broken as a result of numerous reasons. As pipes and cables are buried in the ground most of the time and could not be accessible visually, locating the destructed area is a major challenge. To this aim, Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) could be helpful to locate the approximate location of the discrepancy in pipes and save a huge amount of time and budget. However, because the surrounding medium obstructs access to the pipes and causes clutter it could prevent the system to perform properly. Therefore, clutter reduction techniques are very instrumental to resolve this problem. This article presents Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), Principle Component Analysis (PCA), Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) as clutter reduction algorithms. These algorithms are applied to a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) measurement system. Phase Shift Migration (PSM) is applied for image reconstruction. A scenario of a GPR scan was conducted to locate a discontinuity in buried pipes and the resulting images of diverse algorithms are compared by their Signal to Clutter and Noise Ratio (SCNR) and Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR). All of the algorithms are capable of detecting the crack but based on the comparisons, Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) and Independent Component Analysis (ICA) would be better options for GPR imaging.

AB  - Continuous condition monitoring and fault diagnosis of motor bearings are vital to guarantee motor safety operation and reduce breakdown losses. With numerous Internet of things (IoT) sensors being installed on motors for condition monitoring, data transmission and storage problems have become new challenges. This study designed a signal enhancement and compression (SEC) method and implemented on an IoT platform for motor bearing fault diagnosis. First, vibration signal is acquired from an accelerometer installed on the motor. The bearing signal is demodulated using an online demodulation algorithm. Second, an envelope signal is downsampled and enhanced using a stochastic resonance-based nonlinear filter. The enhanced signal is compressed using an Opus encoder and transmitted to a receiver. Lastly, the received signal is decompressed using the Opus decoder, and the bearing fault type can be recognized. The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed SEC method are verified on an IoT platform compared with a conventional method. The proposed method improves 3.83 dB of the average signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and reduces 94.7% of the total time and 94.6% of the dissipative power. The advantages of the proposed SEC method include high output SNR, low power consumption, and compatibility with edge computing. These advantages show potential applications in remote motor fault diagnosis using battery power supply.

AB  - Long-term ambulatory monitoring of the fetal heart rate (fHR) can greatly increase insight into fetal well-being and reduce pregnancy risks. Unfortunately, the existing solutions using wet or dry electrodes are unsuitable for long-term fHR monitoring due to the use of a gel or direct skin contact. Capacitive electrodes can measure an electrocardiographic (ECG) signal through clothes and, therefore, are perfectly suitable for long-term monitoring of the fHR. However, capacitive fetal ECG (fECG) measurements are challenging due to the high sensitivity of capacitive sensors to motion artifacts (MAs) and the low amplitude of the fECG. This article aims at investigating the feasibility of fECG measurements using capacitive electrodes with dedicated postprocessing algorithms for signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) improvement and MA reduction. To this end, a novel simulator of the full measurement chain is realized that generates multichannel capacitive fECG data with artificial MAs and system noise. A dedicated blind source separation (BSS) algorithm is then employed for MA removal and fECG extraction. The extracted fECG is evaluated by SNR calculation and R-peak detection. Our results show that the BSS algorithm may extract the fECG signal from noisy capacitive data. In addition, lower system noise or higher number of channels may lead to better fECG extraction. A maximum increase of 0.5 dB in the SNR and decrease of 80.7 % in the R-peak detection error are observed with increased electrode number from 8 to 20. Our findings provide useful insights for the hardware design of a capacitive fECG measurement system.

AB  - We design an efficient robust multi-group multicast beamforming scheme for massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. Assuming only estimates of the channel covariance matrices are available at the base station with a bounded error, we formulate the robust quality-of-service (QoS) problem, which is to minimize the transmit power subject to the worst-case minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) guarantee. We directly solve the worst-case SINR problem and convert the robust QoS constraint into a number of non-convex constraints. Based on the recent convergence result of the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) for non-convex problems, we develop an ADMM-based fast algorithm to directly tackle the reformulated non-convex problem with a convergence guarantee. The algorithm contains two layers of ADMM procedures. We design the outer-layer ADMM to decompose the problem into three convex subproblems and solve them alternatingly. We further develop an inner-layer consensus-ADMM-based algorithm to efficiently solve one subproblem. By exploring each subproblem structure and developing the special optimization techniques, we obtain closed-form or semi-closed-form solutions to each subproblem. These results lead to a fast iterative algorithm, which is guaranteed to converge to a stationary point of the original robust QoS problem. Simulation shows that our proposed algorithm provides a favorable performance compared with existing alternative methods with magnitudes of computational complexity reduction.

AB  - This paper presented a cross-correlation-based FBG wavelength offset detection algorithm, applied it to transformer condition monitoring, significantly improved the accuracy of measurement. The test results show that the measurement error of central wavelength can be limited between 2pm and 3pm in the SNR range of 7dB to 14db. Under high SNR conditions, the absolute error can be reduced to approximately 0.5 pm. Therefore, the demodulation algorithm can effectively reduce the influence of noise, and help to further study the characteristics of the FBG sensor demodulation system, thereby improving the transformer condition monitoring accuracy.

AB  - Heart rate is one of the most important indicators of health status. In place of conventional contact-based devices, contactless vital sensing methods that utilize radio waves have been attracting attention. Among them, channel state information (CSI) available with commodity Wi-Fi devices can be used for measuring heart rate. However, existing methods fail to capture individual heartbeat intervals, though it is the most useful information for health and emotion recognition. The fast Fourier transform with a long time window has been necessary to overcome the inherently low signal-amplitude of the heartbeat in CSI. In this study, we propose a time domain method to estimate heart rate variability (HRV) using commodity Wi-Fi devices. The proposed method combines two techniques: (1) denoising by CSI quotient model, and (2) signal selection based on a standard deviation of NN intervals (SDNN) and averaging. Experiments show that the proposed method for the first time achieves accurate estimation of HRV of a 130ms average RMS error, demonstrating that commodity Wi-Fi devices can be used to extract HRV.

AB  - Axle-box bearing condition monitoring is important for the prognostics and health management (PHM) of high-speed trains. Temperature is an important indicator of the health of rotating machinery. It increases significantly when the machinery reaches a certain stage of failure. However, technologies based on temperature sensor signals for monitoring the status of high-speed train's axle-box bearings have rarely been reported to date. This paper proposes a novel condition-monitoring method called the “abnormality index model,” which is based on the local outlier factor (LOF) algorithm, for detecting the potential failures in the axle-box bearings of high-speed trains using temperature sensor signals obtained from a wireless transmission device system (WTDS). The proposed method is capable of quantifying the bearing condition as well as reducing any random noise from the external environment that may interfere with the measurement of the temperature signals of the train. WTDS temperature sensor signals for different failure modes were utilized to evaluate the effectiveness of the LOF-based condition-monitoring approach. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively detect temperature signs associated with the health state of the axle-box bearings and uncover the potential failures, even beforehand.

AB  - Recently, distributed optical fiber acoustic sensing (DAS) is regarded as a transformative technology in seismic exploration. However, both various complex background noise and weak desired signals significantly limit its practical application. To explore an effective denoising method for the vertical seismic profile (VSP) record received by DAS, we propose an improved residual encoder–decoder deep neural network (RED-Net) enhanced by deep iterative memory block (DMB) and channel aggregation block (CAB), called residual channel aggregation encoder–decoder network (RCEN). Here, DMB uses the weight accumulation theory to improve the feature extraction ability and achieve accurate noise elimination. Meanwhile, CAB, using the multi-channel analysis architecture, enhances the weak signal retention performance. In addition, we leverage both the synthetic data obtained by forward modeling and real DAS noise data to construct a sufficient training dataset with high authenticity, thereby meeting the requirement of network training. Both the synthetic and field DAS-VSP data processing results demonstrate the advantage of RCEN compared with competing algorithms, including singular value decomposition (SVD), conventional RED-Net, and feed-forward denoising convolutional neural network (DnCNN).

AB  - Monitoring Health parameters like Heart Rate (HR), Blood Pressure (BP), Oxygen level in blood (SpO2) etc., is demanding in recent times that has led to many wearable devices. HR is estimated from Photoplethysmography (PPG) signal using PPG sensors. The HR estimation during physical exercise is challenging because of the presence of Motion Artifacts (MA). A novel de-noising algorithm that reduces MA present in PPG signal is proposed. In this proposed de-noising algorithm, the combination of Normalized Least Mean Square (NLMS) and Recursive Least Squares (RLS) adaptive filters are used. The PPG signal de-noised by NLMS and RLS adaptive filters are combined together by means of convex combination. The HR is estimated in the frequency domain by taking the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of the de-noised signal. The performance of this technique is evaluated using the IEEE Signal Processing cup 2015 dataset. The HR estimation is improved by using the proposed de-noising algorithm and an error of 0.96 beats per minute (BPM) is achieved.

AB  - The localized faults of rotating machinery can be diagnosed by the extraction of the periodic transient impulses (PTIs); however, the PTI is generally weak and may get submerged in strong noise. To address this issue, a novel approach based on nonconvex sparse regularization denoising and adaptive sparse decomposition is proposed. The main work can be divided into two areas: 1) raw signal denoising and 2) repetitive impulses isolation. Specifically, for the raw signal denoising, the augmented Huber function is proposed as penalty function, and the convexity of the objective cost function (OCF) can be maintained; meanwhile, the solution of the proposed OCF can be solved using forward-backward splitting algorithm. For the repetitive impulses isolation, due to the commonly used resonance-based signal sparse decomposition (RSSD) method lacks adaptability and flexibility in practical application, the genetic algorithm (GA) is introduced to optimize the decomposition parameters of the RSSD that are selected adaptively in the desirable range according to the denoised signal in terms of the global optimization characteristic of GA. As an example, a pinion gear with weak root-crack failure is investigated based on the proposed approach. Compared to some state-of-the-art methods such as L1-norm fused lasso optimization (LFLO) and maximum correlated kurtosis deconvolution method, the results demonstrate that the proposed approach can effectively extract the weak fault frequency and its harmonics, and the shortcoming of the systematic underestimation of LFLO method has also been greatly improved.

AB  - Inertial sensor errors are an important error source in strapdown inertial navigation systems (SINS). These errors are divided into two groups: systematic and random. Systematic errors include offset and scale factor errors, which are estimated using special calibration methods. Random errors, however, can lead to instability of the offset or scale factor over time, which is a key component leading to the increase in SINS errors over time. In this paper we consider a method for reducing random noise in an inertial gyroscope signal using a hybrid deep recurrent neural network consisting of subnets: long short-term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent units (GRU). One of the most important tasks of constructing an adequate deep neural network structure is finding optimal network hyperparameters, which is solved in this work using the Bayesian optimization method. The obtained results are of great importance for solving the problem of the initial SINS alignment.

AB  - Effective signal denoising methods are essential for science and engineering. In general, denoising algorithms may be either linear or non-linear. Most of the linear ones are unable to remove the noise from the real-world measurements. More suitable methods are usually based on non-linear approaches. One of the possible algorithms to signal denoising is based on empirical mode decomposition. The typical approach to the empirical mode decomposition-based signal denoising is the partial reconstruction. More recently, a new concept inspired by the wavelet thresholding principle was proposed. The method is named the interval thresholding. In this article, we further extend the concept by the application of the sparse reconstruction to the empirical mode decomposition-based signal denoising algorithm. To this end, we state and then solve the problem of signal denoising as a regularization problem. In the article, we consider three cases, that is, three types of penalty functions. The first algorithm is combining total variation denoising with empirical mode decomposition approach. In the second one, we applied the fused LASSO Signal Approximator to design the empirical mode decomposition-based signal denoising algorithm. The third approach solves the denoising problem by applying a non-convex sparse regularization. The proposed algorithms were validated on synthetic and real-world signals. We found that the proposed methods have the ability to improve the accuracy of the signal denoising in comparison to the reference methods. Significant improvements from both the synthetic and the real-world signals were obtained for the algorithm based on non-convex sparse regularization. The presented results show that the proposed approach to signal denoising based on empirical mode decomposition algorithm and sparse regularization gives a great improvement of accuracy, and it is the promising direction of future research.

AB  - Fetal magnetoencephalography (fMEG) is a method to record human fetal brain signals in pregnant mothers. Nevertheless the amplitude of the fetal brain signal is very small and the fetal brain signal is overlaid by interfering signals mainly caused by maternal and fetal heart activity. Several methods are used to attenuate the interfering signals for the extraction of the fetal brain signal. However currently used methods are often affected by a reduction of the fetal brain signal or redistribution of the fetal brain signal. To overcome this limitation we developed a new fully automated procedure for removal of heart activity (FAUNA) based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Ridge Regression. We compared the results with an orthogonal projection (OP) algorithm which is widely used in fetal research. The analysis was performed on simulated data sets containing spontaneous and averaged brain activity. The new analysis was able to extract fetal brain signals with an increased signal to noise ratio and without redistribution of activity across sensors compared to OP. The attenuation of interfering heart signals in fMEG data was significantly improved by FAUNA and supports fully automated evaluation of fetal brain signal.

AB  - Multimodal learning has been proven to be an effective method to improve speech enhancement (SE) performance, especially in challenging situations such as low signal-to-noise ratios, speech noise, or unseen noise types. In previous studies, several types of auxiliary data have been used to construct multimodal SE systems, such as lip images, electropalatography, or electromagnetic midsagittal articulography. In this paper, we propose a novel EMGSE framework for multimodal SE, which integrates audio and facial electromyography (EMG) signals. Facial EMG is a biological signal containing articulatory movement information, which can be measured in a non-invasive way. Experimental results show that the proposed EMGSE system can achieve better performance than the audio-only SE system. The benefits of fusing EMG signals with acoustic signals for SE are notable under challenging circumstances. Furthermore, this study reveals that cheek EMG is sufficient for SE.

AB  - In recent years, the development of multi-sensor has emphasized the need to directly process multi-channel (multivariate) data. In this paper, a novel multivariate synchrosqueezing wavelet transform denoising method combined with subspace projection (SWT-SP) is proposed. One of the key points of this method is to obtain an optimal orthogonal matrix which can project a multivariate observation signal to a signal subspace occupied by a clean signal and an orthogonal noise subspace occupied by noise. Furthermore, the high dimensional time-frequency representation based on the synchrosqueezing transform realizes the multichannel signal information fusion, and the subspace projection makes full use of the spatial diversity characteristics of the observed signal. Finally, signal energy produces the aggregation effect in the former dimension space, which improves the signal-to-noise ratio(SNR) of signals in the signal subspace. The performance of this algorithm for standard multichannel denoising is verified on both real-world data and synthetic signals. The reconstructed signal obtained the improvement of the highest SNR by about 6 dB under different conditions.

AB  - This paper presents E-Nose, a novel cost-effective, field-deployable portable system that constitutes a 4-channel signal conditioning circuit and multi-coated piezo-resistive micro-cantilever sensors for explosive sensing. E-Nose also features an embedded PCA and K-means based pattern recognition (PR) algorithm for the classification of explosives from non-explosives. The 4-channel configuration is a stack of two 2-channel circuits that are capable of measuring the change in the sensor resistance or capacitance in four optional modes of ΔR-Δ R,ΔR-ΔC,Δ C-ΔR, and ΔC-ΔC by using time multiplexing. The circuit uses a bidirectional AC current excitation method to drive the sensor bridge for significant reduction of DC offset errors, 1/f noise, line noise, and DC drifts. The proposed signal conditioning circuit uses the phase-sensitive synchronous rectification(PSSR) method for AC-to-DC conversion by using balanced demodulation. The circuit can measure a wide range of resistors that range from 100 Ω to 4 MΩ, with a sensitivity of 0.4mV/ppm and the worst relative error of 2.6%. The capacitive measurement range is from 100pF to 100 μF with the worst relative error of 3.3%. The entire data processing and the PR algorithms run on Raspberry Pi (R-Pi), which is integrated into the E-Nose system. The system performance is tested with MEMS cantilevers for the detection of explosive compounds, such as TNT and its derivatives, RDX and PETN in a controlled environment at a concentration that was as low as 16ppb TNT, 56ppb RDX and 134ppb of PETN. Measurements show that the E-Nose can detect explosives with 77% as true positive results without considering the environmental and mixed vapor effects.

AB  - The variation of geomagnetic field greatly increases the difficulty of magnetic anomaly detection. This paper propose an improved adaptive coherent noise suppression(ACNS) method, which provides an effective denoising method for magnetic anomaly detection. Firstly, the signal of three-axis fluxgate sensor and their total magnetic field signal are denoised by the ACNS method, secondly, the four groups of signal above are summed by the adaptive weighted summation method, and then we use OBF algorithm to get the energy of the signal, achieve the goal of magnetic anomaly detection. Finally, the experimental results show that the improved method in this paper has better denoising effect than the original method, and the magnetic anomaly can be detected better by OBF algorithm after using the improved ACNS algorithm.

AB  - Objective: Noise reduction algorithms in current hearing devices lack informationabout the sound source a user attends to when multiple sources are present. To resolve this issue, they can be complemented with auditory attention decoding (AAD) algorithms, which decode the attention using electroencephalography (EEG) sensors. State-of-the-art AAD algorithms employ a stimulus reconstruction approach, in which the envelope of the attended source is reconstructed from the EEG and correlated with the envelopes of the individual sources. This approach, however, performs poorly on short signal segments, whilelonger segments yield impractically long detection delays when the user switches attention. Methods: We propose decoding the directional focus of attention using filterbank common spatial pattern filters (FB-CSP) as an alternative AAD paradigm, whichdoes not require access to the clean source envelopes. Results: The proposed FB-CSP approach outperforms both the stimulus reconstruction approach on short signal segments, as well as a convolutional neural network approach on the same task. We achieve a high accuracy (80% for 1 s windows and 70% for quasi-instantaneous decisions), which is sufficient to reach minimal expected switch durations below 4 s. We also demonstrate that the decoder can adapt to unlabeled data from anunseen subject and works with only a subset of EEG channels located around the ear to emulate a wearable EEG setup. Conclusion: The proposed FB-CSP method provides fast and accurate decoding of the directional focus of auditory attention. Significance: The high accuracy on very short data segments is a major step forward towards practical neuro-steered hearing devices.

AB  - Deep Learning (DL) models have been used extensively in image processing and other domains with great success but only very recently have been used in processing electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. Effective and powerful methods for denoising real ECG signals are important for wearable sensors and devices. This paper presents the design of a DL model, the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), together with the more conventional filtering methods (low pass filtering, high pass filtering, Notch filtering) and the standard wavelet-based technique for denoising ECG signals. This combination shows to produce better results than using only the CNN models. The methods are trained, tested and evaluated on real ECG datasets taken from the MIT PhysioNet database. The results show the CNN model is a performant model that can be used for denoising ECG signals, and also that before applying the CNN model, standard filtering of the original ECG signal has a beneficial effect for the final results. All CNN models used an NVIDIA TITAN V Graphical Processing Unit (GPU) with 12 GB RAM, which reduces drastically the computational times.

AB  - During the acquisition of the speech signal by the non-contact Speech Sensor (SS), the signal is degraded by severe colored noises which are non-linear and non-uniform in nature. Therefore, in this study, a new approach for advancing the speech enhancement technique is proposed to suppress these noises from the acquired speech signal. This technique is based on the adaptive thresholding, which uses Mean Median Deviation (MMD) method to determine adaptive threshold points, and Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) method. This algorithm has been validated by simulation data, and results of the proposed algorithm have been compared with other existing enhancement algorithms. Spectrograms and Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) comparison are used to analyze the quality of the enhanced speech signal. From the results, we demonstrate that the proposed algorithm offers better speech enhancement than previously existing speech enhancement techniques.

AB  - Noises from the measurement sensors are inevitable in radar cross Section testing due to the thermal agitation of electrons in imperfect conductors. Existing methods represented by wavelet threshold usually regard the measured data as a stationary stochastic signal, ignoring the inherent influence of the target under test, which inevitably removes the signal’s component when noise increases. This paper proposes a novel perspective on 2-D radar cross Section measurement denoising, considering the target’s inherent scattering characteristics (ISC). In the proposed method, the noise and the target are firstly separated as far as possible in the generalized Fourier series domain while the target’s component is all preserved. Then, the noise is further suppressed by the scattered field reconstruction of the Hankel function. Finally, a metal sphere being a calibrator is introduced to improve the denoising ability. Both simulations and experimental studies demonstrate the superiority of our method compared with existing algorithms. Results indicate that the proposed method can achieve higher accuracy.

AB  - The delay-and-sum (DAS) algorithm is widely used for beamforming in linear array photoacoustic (PA) imaging systems and is characterized by fast execution. However, these algorithms suffer from various drawbacks, such as low resolution, low contrast, high sidelobe artifacts, and lack of visual coherence. More recently, adaptive weighting was introduced to improve the reconstruction image quality. Unfortunately, the existing state-of-the-art adaptive beamforming algorithms are computationally expensive and do not consider the specific noise characteristics of the acquired ultrasonic signal. In this article, we present a new adaptive weighting factor named the variational coherence factor (VCF), which takes into account the noise level variations of radio frequency data. The proposed technique provides superior results in terms of image resolution, sidelobe reduction, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and contrast level improvement. The quantitative results of the microsphere phantom imaging show that the proposed VCF-assisted DAS method leads to 55% and 25% improvements in full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) and 57% and 32% improvement in SNR, respectively, compared to the state-of-the-art DAS-based methods. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively improve the reconstructed image quality and deliver satisfactory imaging performance even with a limited number of sensor elements. The proposed method can potentially reduce the instrumentation cost of the PA imaging system and contribute toward the clinical translation of the modality.

AB  - Human bowel sounds (BSs) convey valuable information on gastrointestinal health. Recently, the application of wearable healthcare systems has made it possible to monitor long-term human BSs. However, for the sake of protecting user privacy and reducing the data transmission volume, it is necessary to conduct coarse-grained BS sifting at the wearable sensor sides. In this brief, an edge BS recognition algorithm is proposed, which aims to pick the resting-state BS events and effectively reject the sound segments which contain only the background noises such as the speech and white Gaussian noise (WGN). The algorithm is highlighted with a time-domain histogram feature and a binarized CNN that is uniquely optimized for BS recognition. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm reaches 99.92% classification accuracy with a very low false alarm rate. Moreover, the algorithm is validated by hardware implementation and the computation overhead reduction ratio reaches 58.28 in terms of overall operations, in comparison with similar works in literature. These advantages indicate that our algorithm is suitable to be deployed on those edge devices with limited resources.

AB  - The idea behind this paper was stimulated by known of the theory of automatic control definition concern potential pulse characteristics. It is used for increase of metrological accuracy of the distributed temperature sensor. All known works used averaging of the pulse response or its processing on certain algorithms for reduction of an error of transformation. It is bad idealization of used pulse signals for simplification of calculations. Thus it is supposed by default that risetime and decrease of pulse top do not influence to accuracy. The given approach does not consider an error due the transitive characteristic for any signal transferred through system with finite number of elements. It is shown that in actual life it mismatches the validity. A new distributed temperature sensor structure with the characteristics nearly to so-called potentially achievable is proposed. It is offered to use the mathematical theory of potentially achievable pulse characteristics for definition of limitations of accuracy of the pulse converter. Thus our approach is a refusal of signal idealization otherwise use the constructive methods of approximation. The new approach allows to consider transient parameters: the risetime duration, cut-off, deadtime, and peak overshoot. In turn, it minimized an error related with methods of temperature calculation. For modeling the reflected signal is presented in the form of Lanne polynomials. The second polynomial Remez algorithm has been used for finding of peak overshoot. Finally, in the paper the operation principle of distributed temperature sensor is resulted. The methods related decreasing of noise influence to measurement are designated. Some practical advice on increase accuracy of measurement by distributed temperature sensor is given.

AB  - Summary form only given. Compressed sensing-based CMOS image sensor (CS-CIS) has gained significant interest in the past few years. It can greatly reduce on-chip processor complexity, transmission cost, and storage requirement compared to conventional sampling method using Nyquist-Shannon rate. CS-CIS performs acquisition and compression simultaneously and transfers all heavy computation burden components to decoder, where the measurement streams can be processed and analyzed with unlimited resources, resulting in a low-complexity encoder. Thus, it is very suitable for transmitting only applications, where computational resource and power is limited. However, spatial and temporal redundancy in measurement has become a primary concern which it is necessary to further compress. In this paper, we proposed temporal redundancy reduction in compressive video sensing by using moving detection and inter-coding. Firstly, the moving detection is performed coding area extraction using local adaptive threshold to classify the measurement with an association of error distinction. However, false-positive detection could be occurred randomly, which transmission cost can be increasing uncertainty. To reduce transmission costs, the adaptive quantization parameters are adjusted by how frequently the area is detected. Moreover, we further compress the detected area by encoding the difference of current measurement and the best-matched measurement in neighboring frames. Finally, an efficient recovery algorithm of sparse signal is performed by using -minimization via primal-dual interior-point algorithm and reconstructed by inverse fast Walsh-Hadamard transform with horizontal kernel filter to prevent staircase artifacts simultaneously. The experimental results show that our proposed can greatly reduce bandwidth usage in terms of BPP by 63.15%, improve in PSNR by 1.56dB, and SSIM by 14.81% on average when compared to the state-of-the-art works.

AB  - This paper proposes a reliable fault detection model for a pressure vessel under low pressure conditions. To improve the diagnostic performance, signals of different vessel health conditions are purified by eliminating noise so that signals of different categories are much more distinguishable. This de-noising technique uses a blind source separation (BSS) technique in which an initial noise-contaminated signal is separated into constituent sources. These individual sources are either device status-characterizing signal sources or interfering sources. Noise is removed and an unimpaired signal is regenerated from the characteristic sources. An abundant pool of heterogenous features are extracted from a refined signal to avoid omitting important fault-related properties. However, some of these fault features may be redundant and irrelevant, and they are likely to cause classification performance degradation. To choose the most discriminative fault-signatures from a plentiful feature set as well as reduce the dimensions of the feature input, this study proposes a new feature selection algorithm that associates a genetic algorithm (GA)-based discriminative feature analysis to a k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) classifier. The efficacy of involved techniques and the overall fault diagnostic model is examined in terms of visual and qualitative evaluations. Experimental results illustrated in this study justify that the proposed fault detection model is promising and outstanding compared to other state-of-the-art counterparts.

AB  - Graph Signal Processing (GSP) leverages pair-wise relationship between nodes of a graph to formulate operators on signals defined over the nodes. Most existing graph signal operators in the literature are linear, and can be described by linear transformation matrices. Recently, works are emerging that consider the time correlation of graph signals, leading to time-vertex signal processing. By exploiting the joint correlations across the graph topology and time, better results can be obtained. In this brief, we propose a median operator that will leverage the joint correlation, for denoising time-varying graph signals. The median operator, known for its robustness to outliers in statistics, has been very successful in traditional signal processing, especially for images. The efficient and highly localised graph median filters developed here are applied to denoising real world sensor network data. Real world sensor nodes are usually resource limited in terms of their computational and communication capacity, hence the imperative requirement for efficient localised filters. Comprehensive experimental results will show that in some cases, the performance is significantly better than the equivalent linear operator counterpart.

AB  - In this article, we discuss a novel signal processing technique for adaptive radar that permits joint target-matched illumination and interference avoidance in dynamic spectral environments. This approach allows for spectral coexistence between a radar system and a primary user of the radio frequency space. Spectral coexistence is exploited to allow the use of higher bandwidths than would otherwise be available to conventional radar systems. The technique proposed exploits the relative simplicity of the error reduction algorithm, and also provides a novel use of the masking procedure to allow for target-matched illumination. Practical constraints such as constant modulus are considered in the waveform design procedure, while providing an implied signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio improvement via the error reduction algorithm. Results for full simulation and hardware-in-the-loop experiments are presented and analyzed. We are able to show a signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio gain of 40 dB is achieved for the target-matched waveform as compared with a linear frequency modulated waveform. However, the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio gain comes at a cost of degraded autocorrelation characteristics of the target-matched illumination waveform, despite only modest levels of primary user spectrum occupancy. Spectral notch depths achieved by the modified error reduction algorithm are approximately 25 dB.

AB  - Intelligent fault diagnosis of bearings has been a heated research topic in the prognosis and health management of rotary machinery systems, due to the increasing amount of available data collected by sensors. This has given rise to more and more business desire to apply data-driven methods for health monitoring of machines. In recent years, various deep learning algorithms have been adapted to this field, including multi-layer perceptrons, autoencoders, convolutional neural networks, and so on. Among these methods, autoencoder is of particular interest for us because of its simple structure and its ability to learn useful features from data in an unsupervised fashion. Previous studies have exploited the use of autoencoders, such as denoising autoencoder, sparsity aotoencoder, and so on, either with one layer or with several layers stacked together, and they have achieved success to certain extent. In this paper, a bearing fault diagnosis method based on fully-connected winner-take-all autoencoder is proposed. The model explicitly imposes lifetime sparsity on the encoded features by keeping only k% largest activations of each neuron across all samples in a mini-batch. A soft voting method is implemented to aggregate prediction results of signal segments sliced by a sliding window to increase accuracy and stability. A simulated data set is generated by adding white Gaussian noise to original signals to test the diagnosis performance under noisy environment. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we compare our methods with some state-of-the-art bearing fault diagnosis methods. The experiments result show that, with a simple two-layer network, the proposed method is not only capable of diagnosing with high precision under normal conditions, but also has better robustness to noise than some deeper and more complex models.

AB  - This paper presents the sensing resolution improvement of Brillouin distributed temperature sensor (BDTS) using signal processing technique. The sensor is designed for 70 km sensing range using optical time domain reflectometry (OTDR) technique. We have compared the performance of designed sensor in terms of sensing resolution using different denoising algorithms such as dichotomize singular value decomposition (D-SVD) algorithm, Fourier-Wavelet Regularized Deconvolution (ForWaRD) algorithm and Lifting Wavelet algorithm. The temperature resolution is obtained as 11 K using D-SVD algorithm at 70 km distance. However, the temperature resolution as 29 K is observed without using denoising algorithm at same distance. An improvement of temperature resolution as 18 K is observed using D-SVD algorithm. In addition, the improvement of sensing resolution is observed in D-SVD algorithm compared to other denoising algorithms.

AB  - Signal acquisition from the wrist using wearable device is usually corrupted by noise, sometimes up to a level where the noise completely dominates the signal. In this paper, we use the acquisition of photoplethysmography (PPG) signal as an example to demonstrate our proposed algorithm implemented on a sensor array. To increase the chances of acquiring clean PPG signal, we develop a uniform linear sensor array located above the radial artery. We also develop a wearable device to integrate our sensor array and our proposed algorithm. We propose centralized state sensing (CSS), a centralized algorithm suited to our sensor array, to increase the efficiency in multi-sensor estimation. To support our proposed algorithm, we use heart rate estimation as an example and compare it with the estimation of a single sensor and the statistical mean of the estimation of multiple sensors. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposal achieve a reduction in mean absolute error of 26.8%, compared to the estimation result obtained using the average of the estimation of all sensors. Operating on a 80 MHz processor, our algorithm introduces a 8 ms overhead, making it highly suitable for wearable devices.

AB  - In this paper, we present a hybrid denoising algorithm dedicated to division-of-focal plane (DoFP) polarization images. The proposed algorithm, centered around the Block-Matching and 3D Filtering (BM3D) and K-times Singular Value Decomposition (KSVD) denoising algorithms, is capable of significantly enhancing the grouping step in the second round of collaborative filtering by purifying the “Semi-Filtered” image yielded by the first round of collaborative filtering. To achieve this, the BM3D denoising method's chain of operation is broken, and the “Semi-Filtered” image is passed through a round of KSVD denoising method before the second round of collaborative filtering is conducted. According to our extensive experimental results, the proposed algorithm visually outperforms the state-of-the-art BM3D denoising algorithm and a wide range of other denoising algorithms for DoFP polarization images. Quantitative results presented using Peak-Signal-to-Noise-Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) Index metrics further highlight the superior performance of the proposed algorithm.

AB  - The long-existing problem of high positioning inaccuracy by triangulation in the far region in short-range vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication environments is investigated in this study. The triangulation is achieved by sensing angle of arrival with two optical signal-direction sensors developed in our previous works. The measured signal-direction error can be categorized into two different kinds, namely systematic error and random error. The former is mainly incurred by imperfect calibration of hardware and misalignment of signal-direction sensors as well as multipath scattering of the signal. The latter is caused by random noises. Both of them lead to positioning error. By utilizing the specific characteristics pertaining to the triangulation measurements, it is possible to extract the target location and increase the accuracy with an optimization algorithm. With the aid of a general-purpose optimization subroutine together with two proper objective functions developed in this study, this work shows the viability of this idea. With the technique proposed in this paper, precise hardware calibration and careful alignment of signal-direction sensors are unnecessary. The problem of multipath scattering can also be mitigated. This work indicates a possible direction to treat the problem of high inaccuracy in noisy and ill-geometric environments in triangulation measurement. The abovementioned signal-direction sensors are currently constructed for infrared light. By changing the signal sources and detectors, they can also be fabricated for visible light. Such an alteration of transmission medium is beneficial for the currently emerging short-range visible-light intervehicular communications.

AB  - Image analysis has been used in a very large scale for different purposes. When an image is captured by a digital sensor, it is usually affected by some type of noise, even the smoothest ones. Therefore, image enhancement and denoising process are important tasks of digital image processing. This paper presents an algorithm to reduce non-stationary noise with the combination of a Low-Pass Filter (LPF) and a High-Pass Filter (HPF), in conjunction with an adaptive semantic model. To simulate the usefulness of such arrangement, a non-stationary Gaussian noise has been applied to an image, which has been splitted into the four quadrants, all of them having the same dimensions. In fact, such a noise with different intensities, has been added to the image in each of its quadrants. The Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) has been used to measure the best cutoff frequencies for both filters, as well as rules based on semantic concepts have been structured for decision making. Furthermore, for the validation of the algorithm we have taken into account the evaluation of the Mean Squared Error (MSE) using a typical digital image obtained from a crop of maize with the presence of the earwornm (Helicoverpa Zea). Besides, the denoising process demonstrates the efficiency and the satisfactory performance for the non-stationary noise filtering in agricultural images.

AB  - Partial discharge (PD) location techniques are a useful tool for condition monitoring of electrical apparatus in power systems. However, the noisy PD measurements may significantly degrade the performance of location algorithms. This paper deals with the PD location problem by using adaptive filtering techniques. Heretofore, scarce literature focuses on addressing the PD location based on such method. A novel adaptive algorithm, termed as total least-squares (TLS)-Matern kernel (TLS-MK), is proposed. Benefiting from the merits of the Matern kernel, the TLS model can effectively suppress the noise from the direct and reflected waves of the PD source. Meanwhile, the TLS-MK algorithm is used to estimate the time difference which is used in the PD location. Moreover, the convergence behavior of the TLS-MK algorithm is analyzed. Simulations and experiments show that the proposed algorithm can enhance the location accuracy as compared to state-of-the-art methods for various PD signals.

AB  - Raman-based distributed temperature sensing (RDTS) can achieve temperature measurement of tens of kilometers and is widely used in temperature monitoring of crucial facilities. The accuracy of RDTS is highly determined by the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the acquired spontaneous Raman scattering (SpRS) signals, which is about 60 dB weaker than the pump pulse. Therefore, the performance of single-mode fiber (SMF) based conventional RDTS is poor. To improve its performance, many methods have been proposed, including the use of special optical fibers, pulse coding techniques, and denoising algorithms. However, these methods have their limitations. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a deep 1-D denoising convolutional neural network (1DDCNN) to enhance the performance of RDTS. A simplified RDTS model is built to train and optimize the 1DDCNN. To verify the performance of the 1DDCNN on actual data, we experimentally measure the SpRS data of a 10-km SMF with an average time of 1 s and a spatial resolution of 3 m. The well-trained 1DDCNN reduces the temperature uncertainty from 6.4 °C to 0.7 °C with high fidelity. As a comparison, the commonly used wavelet denoising algorithm can only reduce it to 3.7 °C. Besides, the 1DDCNN does not require manual parameter adjustment and is not affected by the sampling rate, giving it significant advantages in practical applications compared with conventional denoising algorithms. Moreover, we believe that the proposed 1DDCNN can be applied to other distributed optical fiber sensing systems by fine-tuning the network with appropriate training data.

AB  - To filter out the phase noise of the Φ-OTDR system, a method based on empirical mode decomposition and Pearson correlation coefficient fusion (EMD-PCC) is proposed. First, the EMD-PCC method is simulated. The experimental results show that the SNR increases from 7.32 dB to 13.68 dB. Second, the beat signal detected by the Φ-OTDR system is demodulated by the I/Q quadrature demodulation method. Finally, the phase signal is decomposed by empirical mode decomposition to obtain the modal function and residual component. The Pearson correlation coefficient with the phase signal is calculated. Then, the threshold value is 0.4-1.0. The modal function within the threshold is superimposed with the residual component signal. In this paper, the experimental verification of PZT analog disturbance signal frequencies of 200 Hz, 300 Hz, 400 Hz and 500 Hz is performed. Then, wavelet denoising and EMD-soft denoising are compared with EMD-PCC denoising. Experimental results show that the proposed method can accurately restore the disturbance signal. The experiment of sawtooth disturbance signal frequencies of 400 Hz and 500 Hz verifies the applicability of the algorithm and shows that the method is suitable for other arbitrary forms of disturbance signals. The Φ-OTDR system has an important application in the field of oil and gas exploration. This method provides a good theoretical basis for the exploration field.

AB  - The issue of the low probability of intercept (LPI) radar signal sensing has received considerable attention. Furthermore, the development of military technology further increased demand for it in future electronic warfare (EW). Meanwhile, so far, a systematic understanding of how radar signal detection and recognition technology contributes to EW is still lacking. Therefore, this study aims to contribute to this growing area of research by exploring an automatic method for detecting and identifying radar signals based on visibility graphs (VG), which can extract more network and feature information in the two-dimensional space of VG. In this article, the signal to be measured is subjected to wavelet noise reduction. Secondly, auto-correlation processing is performed on the signal, we subsequently convert the signal into a VG complex network. Then the average degree and weighted operation of the network are used for signal detection and recognition, respectively. Experiments in the last part indicate that the proposed method provides excellent performance, such as the robustness to noise and the probability of classification, over several state-of-the-art algorithms.

AB  - This letter proposes a limited-memory receive filter design to maximize the output signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar. The associated problem is a minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) one which can be analytical solved, but the computation of the MVDR solution would be prohibitive in the context of massive MIMO radar, due to the huge memory consumption. To this end, we propose a low-complexity algorithm that exploits a reparameterization method to avoid the significant memory consumption, and solves the resulting problem with several simple algebraic operations. We show that the memory consumption of the proposed algorithm depends on the number of interference sources. Therefore, for the scenario with a large number of interference sources, we extend the proposed algorithm by the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), which promotes a further memory reduction. Finally, numerical simulations are conducted to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.

AB  - The time‐domain multichannel signal enhancement problem is an important generalization of the single‐channel case. This chapter explores different, although roughly equivalent, apparent avenues and derive many useful optimal filters for signal enhancement in a variety of contexts. Some important optimal filtering matrices are developed for multichannel noise reduction in the time domain. In order to unify these different algorithms, the chapter offers to use the joint diagonalization technique. It further shows how to exploit the spectrum of each one of the sensors' signals, and discusses the effect of the spatial information, which plays a critical role in multichannel signal enhancement when compared to the single‐channel case. Performance measures are an important area of the signal enhancement problem. Measures are derived related to the noise reduction. Finally, the chapter presents the MSE criterion, which is very convenient to use in signal enhancement applications.

AB  - We propose and experimentally demonstrate an on-chip optical sensor based on a dual-passband microwave photonic filter (MPF) incorporating a silicon photonic integrated microdisk resonator (MDR). Two whispering gallery modes supported by the MDR that are experiencing different wavelength shifts are employed for simultaneous temperature and refractive index (RI) measurements. To increase the interrogation speed and resolution, the MDR is incorporated in an MPF to produce two microwave passbands. By applying a broadband linearly chirped microwave waveform to the MPF, two filtered microwave waveforms with their temporal locations or equivalently central frequencies corresponding to the wavelength shifts of the notches are generated. The measurement of the temporal locations or equivalently the central frequencies is performed at high speed and high resolution using a digital signal processor. To increase the signal-to-noise ratio of the filtered microwave waveforms, a noise reduction algorithm based on phase-only filtering is proposed and employed. The on-chip optical sensing system is experimentally demonstrated. The sensing system can provide high temperature and RI interrogation resolutions of 2.4 × 10-5 °C and 9.1 × 10-8 RIU at a high interrogation speed of 1 MHz.

AB  - Denoising videos in real-time is critical in many applications, including robotics and medicine, where varying-light conditions, miniaturized sensors, and optics can substantially compromise image quality. This work proposes the first video denoising method based on a deep neural network that achieves state-of-the-art performance on dynamic scenes while running in real-time on VGA video resolution with no frame latency. The backbone of our method is a novel, remarkably simple, temporal network of cascaded blocks with forward block output propagation. We train our architecture with short, long, and global residual connections by minimizing the restoration loss of pairs of frames, leading to a more effective training across noise levels. It is robust to heavy noise following Poisson-Gaussian noise statistics. The algorithm is evaluated on RAW and RGB data. We propose a denoising algorithm that requires no future frames to denoise a current frame, reducing its latency considerably. The visual and quantitative results show that our algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance among efficient algorithms, achieving from two-fold to two-orders-of-magnitude speed-ups on standard benchmarks for video denoising.

In this letter, we present an integral-based orthogonal AMP (IB-OAMP) technique that avoids the requirements of AMP (and also the original form of OAMP) on differentiable and separable denoisers. The orthogonality in IB-OAMP can be established using a Monte Carlo method similar to the training stage in a machine-learning algorithm. These features make IB-OAMP attractive to be used in conjunction with some well-studied denoising algorithms.

AB  - In most optical fiber distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) systems, to obtain the desired outcome, the sensing signal acquired by DAS systems normally needs to be denoised. In some applications, such as the identifiation of the position of fast-moving targets, we need DAS systems to respond with sufficient speed. However, most classical denoising algorithms do not work if the signals are insufficiently collected within a short period (called a short-time signal). To obtain ideal results within a short time window, we propose an attention-based convolutional neural network (CNN) structure with extremely short signal windows to learn and approximate the results of classical denoising methods. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, the experiment is conducted under a real field highway scenario where the desired signals are overwhelmed with noise. The results show that by using signals collected within extremely short time windows of 100 ms, an insufficient time for the processing of existing denoising algorithms, our structure yields a satisfactory denoising performance.

AB  - As a novel asynchronous-driven cameras, event-based sensors are with high sensitivity, fast speed, low power consumption and low data volume, but with abundant noise. Since the output of event-based sensors is in the form of address-event-representation (AER), the traditional frame-based denoising method cannot be used. In this paper, we introduce a novel event stream denoising method for such sensors. Effective events tend to show temporal and spatial regularity, while noise events show a kind of randomness. Thus, we build a probabilistic undirected graph model to describe this difference, with which the denoising problem is converted to a probability maximization problem. Then, the model is decomposed into the product of the energy function on the maximum cliques, and the iterated condition model (ICM) is used for energy minimization to obtain the denoised event stream. Experiments show that our method can effectively remove noise events directly from the event stream and significantly improve event recognition rate.

AB  - This paper aims to use only one sensor to achieve better PD fault location of power cables in a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) noise environment. Therefore, an improved phase difference (IPD) method based on one sensor is used to estimate the PD fault location of power cables. This method has a good advantage of using only the first two PD peaks, which is suitable for location estimation in the low SNR noise environment. The white Gaussian noise is regarded as background noise to simulate the noise environment. In order to enhance the accuracy of the IPD method in the noisy environment, a new denoising algorithm combining high-order statistics (HOS) criterion and generalized cross-validation (GCV) thresholding is proposed to process PD signals. The results show the good performance of the proposed denoising algorithm and higher location accuracy of the IPD method in the low SNR noise environment.

AB  - In this letter, we propose a novel system for localization of a wireless sensor network using the localized Procrustes analysis with manifold learning. Due to different environmental factors, such as noise and fading, the internode distances calculated by the received signal strength indicator are erroneous and may not satisfy the L2 norm. The nodes seemingly lie on an unknown high-dimensional manifold that satisfies the Riemannian manifold assumption. Thus, the problem of localization is transformed into the problem of nonlinear dimensionality reduction. The location of the nodes can be learned through a manifold learning algorithm like Isomap. However, the coordinates so obtained needed to be transformed to obtain the correct locations of the nodes. We use the localized Procrustes analysis in order to align the relative locations to the absolute or global locations. The localized Procrustes analysis considers each sensor node's neighborhood and computes distinct parameters for each sensor based on the transformation parameters of the anchors present in its neighborhood. Experiment results show that our proposed system outperformed existing localization schemes and can localize the nodes with a better accuracy up to 31.27% in contrast to the least square optimization method.

AB  - In non-destructive testing and evaluation, the microwave-based synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging have shown great potential in the detection of defects on buried objects such as pipes. However, due to the pipe curvature and high stand-off distance when inspecting an insulated pipe, the useful defect information used to characterize the pipe image is lost as a result of low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), resulting in a blurred and unfocused image. In this paper, we proposed a robust microwave-based SAR imaging using autofocus range-Doppler algorithm (RDA) for the inspection of an insulated pipe. Singular value decomposition is used to mitigate the effect of the insulation layer by removing dominant singular values that characterize the insulation layer, and the autofocus RDA is designed to refocus the SAR image using RDA residual refocusing. The SNR, improvement factor (IF), and squared error are used to evaluate the qualitative image information of the defect on the pipe. Experimental results showed the efficacy of the method in detecting defects on an insulated pipe, in particular, a significant reduction in the noise content of the image compared to the known SAR Omega-k algorithm. It was found that the autofocus RDA gave higher values of SNR and IF (3 dB and 6 dB) compared to the Omega-k algorithm (-1 dB and 2 dB), respectively.

AB  - Image Signal Processor (ISP) comprises of various blocks to reconstruct image sensor raw data to final image consumed by human visual system or computer vision applications. Each block typically has many tuning parameters due to the complexity of the operation. These need to be hand tuned by Image Quality (IQ) experts, which takes considerable amount of time. In this paper, we present an automatic IQ tuning using nonlinear optimization and automatic reference generation algorithms. The proposed method can produce high quality IQ in minutes as compared with weeks of hand-tuned results by IQ experts. In addition, the proposed method can work with any algorithms without being aware of their specific implementation. It was found successful on multiple different processing blocks such as noise reduction, demosaic, and sharpening.

AB  - With the development of semiconductor technology, the performance of many new image sensors, such as infrared focal planes and CMOS image sensors, have been improved. Also, it is an alternative choice of CCD, vacuum tube or other equipment that promotes this kind of sensors to become the mainstream of the market. However, this kind of image sensors has a weakness that is the stripe noise, due to the inconsistent readout circuit response. This noise influences the quality of image directly, as a result, the poor image quality in-benefits for recognition and classification. Thus, how to remove the stripe noise arises the interests for many researchers. Most of them only focus on one certain type of stripe features, instead of combining different features together, leading to the poor performance of denoising. This paper proposes a method of removing stripes that combines feature extraction and function fitting. Firstly, extract the statistics and spatial position of the stripes, and then perform two steps of rough processing and fine processing on the image. The PSNR, SSM value show that the algorithm meets the design expectations and has a certain degree of robustness.

AB  - Ultra-high quality (Q) whispering gallery mode (WGM) optical microcavities have been shown to be sensitive biomolecular sensors due to their long photon confinement times. We have previously experimentally demonstrated that a system known as FLOWER (frequency locked optical whispering evanescent resonator) can detect single macromolecules. FLOWER uses frequency locking in combination with balanced detection and data processing to greatly improve the sensitivity, stabilization, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and the detection limit of ultra-high-Q microcavities. Here we present the analytical basis for FLOWER and explore its limits of detection via numerical simulation. We examine the effects of key parameters such as Q-factor and frequency modulation depth on the SNR of FLOWER. We demonstrate that the frequency locked optical microcavity system is limited by the shot noise from the receiver, as well as the laser intensity noise. Using median filtering in combination with step-fitting algorithms, frequency locked ultra-high-Q microcavities can detect resonance shifts as small as 0.05 attometers at one millisecond time intervals. Our results can guide the choice of experimental parameters to achieve better sensing performance in a variety of target applications, including fundamental studies of protein-protein interactions and medical diagnostics and prognostics.

AB  - We present a novel approach for recovering a sparse signal from quadratic measurements corresponding to a rank-one tensorization of the data vector. Such quadratic measurements, referred to as interferometric or cross-correlated data, naturally arise in many fields such as remote sensing, spectroscopy, holography and seismology. Compared to the sparse signal recovery problem that uses linear measurements, the unknown in this case is a matrix formed by the cross correlations of the sought signal. This creates a bottleneck for the inversion since the number of unknowns grows quadratically with the dimension of the signal. The main idea of the proposed approach is to reduce the dimensionality of the problem by recovering only the diagonal of the unknown matrix, whose dimension grows linearly with the size of the signal, and use an efficient Noise Collector to absorb the cross-correlated data that come from the off-diagonal elements of this matrix. These elements do not carry extra information about the support of the signal, but significantly contribute to these data. With this strategy, we recover the unknown matrix by solving a convex linear problem whose cost is similar to the one that uses linear measurements. Our theory shows that the proposed approach provides exact support recovery when the data is not too noisy, and that there are no false positives for any level of noise. It also demonstrates that the level of sparsity that can be recovered scales almost linearly with the number of data. The numerical experiments presented in the paper corroborate these findings.

AB  - Automated hearing test equipment is a kind of hearing testing system with good environmental adaptability, self-help hearing examination, which can be applied to most people in community. The environment noise is a major obstacle to the measurement accuracy of automated hearing test equipment. The active noise control technology can cancel the noise by generating the reverse sound wave equal to the external noise, so as to achieve the effect of noise reduction. In this paper, an automated hearing test system based on active noise control technology was developed. The designed system mainly included hardware board, noise detection sensor, touch screen, active noise control card, fitting instrument and power supply and the associated devices included earphone, hearing aids and printer. Active noise control technology is used to reducing the interference of environmental noise. A total of 95 volunteers were selected to receive the hearing examination by the automated hearing test system and pure-tone audiometer. The differences of hearing thresholds between automated hearing test system and pure-tone audiometer were less than 5 dB at all frequencies. The evaluation results show that this system provides a quick and convenient automated hearing test method, and can obtain a relatively reliable result.

AB  - Maximizing the achievable SNR benefits the measurement’s precision that is affected by thermal noise, and track precision is enhanced given precise, unbiased, range measurements. While the radar is tracking the kinematic state (i.e., position, velocity, and acceleration) of the target, optimal signal processing requires knowledge of the target’s signature, range rate, and radial acceleration. Increasing the SNR of individual measurements by enhanced signal processing results in reduced settling time for the track filter and less valuable radar resources required to achieve a specified track quality. Moving targets introduce range-walk (RW), which degrades coherent processing leading to a reduction in SNR and a blurring of the point target response in range-Doppler (RD), resulting in degraded range estimates to the Tracker. Traditional radar architectures require excessive iterations of the track loop with the associated measurements to achieve a specified track quality threshold. In this paper, the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, an iterative and inference approach, provides improved parameter estimation and SNR by employing a Kalman filter within the Signal Processor to account for changes in the target’s kinematics. The improved state estimates are used in the Signal Processor to achieved enhanced RW correction.

AB  - Modeling of the underlying noise in a hyperspectral image reveals important information about the characteristics of the hyperspectral sensor and the image itself. While the focus in the literature has mostly been on the estimation of noise statistics, it is also of interest to estimate the actual noise present in each pixel, which can not only directly contribute to denoising of the image but can also aid other image processing algorithms exploiting such information. In this letter, we propose a novel method for per-pixel noise estimation that is also able to deal with spectral correlation in the noise. The method makes no assumptions on the behavior of the underlying noise. Simulation results show that the proposed method performs significantly better than the existing methods in cases where there is a correlation in the noise.

AB  - Surgery navigation techniques aim to support surgeons during operations, resulting in improved accuracy and patient safety. In this context, electromagnetic tracking systems (EMTSs) are mainly used since they enable real-time tracking of small EM sensors included in surgical tools without line-of-sight restrictions. On the other hand, these systems are very sensible to magnetic field variations that can affect sensor position estimation performance. In this paper we analyze how magnetic field variations caused by the noise of transmitting coils' excitation currents affect system performance, and we propose a technique to reduce its undesirable effect. This method includes, in the position estimation algorithm, the measurement of excitation currents, thus compensating errors in sensor signal caused by current noise.Different simulation tests were performed to assess the proposed method which is based on modeling the magnetic field produced by the field generator (FG). Finally, it is validated by using experimental data provided by a novel EMTS prototype, obtaining noise peaks reduction and an overall mean position error of 3 mm at a distance of 600 mm from the FG.

AB  - An ultra-high precision magnetic field measurement is of great scientific and economic significance. An atomic magnetometer that operates in a spin-exchange relaxation-free (SERF) regime has superior sensitivity and, thus, is of great significance for the ultra-high precision magnetic field measurement. In order to reduce the noise of a SERF atomic magnetometer and further improve its sensitivity, a method for noise reduction based on the multigene genetic programming (MGGP) is presented. Different from the existing methods, in this method, the model of magnetometer noise is established based on the experimental data. Namely, the noise of the SERF atomic magnetometer is first modeled by the MGGP algorithm and then reduced by the obtained model. Besides, in this way, the sensitivity is improved. The experimental results indicate that our MGGP model can adequately reflect the characteristics of the SERF magnetometer noise. Moreover, after applying the proposed method, the sensitivity of the SERF magnetometer is improved about 13 times at 1 Hz, and there is also a significant sensitivity increase at the frequencies less than 10 Hz. Therefore, the proposed method can effectively reduce the noise and improve the sensitivity of the SERF magnetometer in the low-frequency band.

AB  - This paper proposes a new fetal monitoring system, including the acquisition and the processing of fetal heart sounds (FHS). Based on the foundation of the stethoscope principle, a single-channel, non-invasive sensor is designed to acquire the fetal heart sounds, in which polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane material is used as the core transducer. In the fetal heart sounds processing part, we propose a new method for denoising based on adaptive support vector regression (SVR) which has a good performance on curve fitting and effectively weakens the interference of additive noise. Thus, the clean fetal heart signals extracted from the interfered source can be further utilized to draw the fetal phonocardiogram (FPCG) and calculate the fetal heart rate (FHR).

AB  - The benefits and limitations inherent to the 2D postprocessing of measurements from Brillouin optical time-domain analyzers are investigated from a fundamental point of view. In a preliminary step, the impact of curve fitting on the precision of the estimated Brillouin frequency shift is analyzed, enabling a fair comparison between the representative noise-reduction algorithms studied in this article. The performances in terms of signal-to-noise ratio, experimental uncertainty σB on the Brillouin frequency shift and spatial resolution delivered by advanced image processing methods-such as wavelet transform and non-local means algorithms-are then compared with the impact of a 2D Gaussian filter. The major discrepancies observed when comparing the gain in signal-to-noise ratio to the σB reduction are then determined by exploiting the separability of the Gaussian filter, which reveals that noise reduction is only effective along 1-D of the 2D array of measurements and originates from a digital reduction of the system analog bandwidth. The signal-to-noise ratio improvement obtained from filtering in the spectral dimension is only illusory, since its action is redundant with the curve fitting procedure to estimate the Brillouin frequency shift. Finally, the maximum σB reduction achievable by digital post-processing is theoretically given, hence setting a fundamental limit to the improvement brought by data processing.

AB  - In recent years, many conventional image denoising techniques have been intensively studied to enhance the signal to noise ratio (SNR) of Brillouin optical time domain analyzer (BOTDA), due to their superior denoising performance to one-dimensional methods. However, in the case of low sampling rate, the details of the signal are smoothed out due to less useful information, resulting in a degradation of the spatial resolution. Moreover, these conventional denoising algorithms are quite time-consuming compared with the BOTDA measuring time. To overcome these drawbacks, we employ a feed-forward convolutional neural networks (CNN) based image denoising for BOTDA. A conventional BOTDA system with 15 ns pulse width is implemented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the exploited CNN-based denoising method. The actual electrical noise signals of the BOTDA at different sampling rates are collected to synthesize training samples. The CNN model is trained with the noise and simulated BOTDA signals. Experimental results show that SNR improvement of 13.43 dB, 13.57 dB, and 12.9 dB is achieved at a sampling rate of 500 MSa/s, 250 MSa/s, and 125 MSa/s, respectively, via the trained CNN denoiser. No spatial resolution distortion can be observed in the denoised BOTDA signals. Besides, the CNN denoiser only takes 0.045 s to process a 151 × 50000 image benefiting from GPU computing. This processing time is negligible compared with the acquisition time of BOTDA, which makes real-time denoising possible.

AB  - In this work, we apply deep learning to estimate the direction-of-arrival (DoA) of multiple narrowband signals with a uniform linear array in a coherent environment. First, the logarithmic eigenvalue-based classification network (LogECNet) is introduced to enhance signal number detection accuracy in challenging scenarios, such as the low signal-to-noise (SNR) regime and limited snapshots. Next, a multi-label classification model called the root-spectrum network (RSNet) is devised to estimate the DoAs using the signal number inferred by LogECNet. In the proposed architecture, the full-row Toeplitz matrices reconstruction (FTMR), which exploits all rows of the signal covariance matrix (SCM), is combined with LogECNet and RSNet to inversely map the SCM to the numerical DoAs in the coherent scenario. It is shown that the eigenvalues factorized from the FTMR output matrix become more robust sources for signal enumeration than those of the forward/backward spatial smoothing (FBSS) algorithm. Furthermore, the logarithmic scaling of the eigenvalues of the FTMR results in LogECNet outperforming other detectors. The simulation results show our proposed method not only improves the signal number detection and angular estimation performance, but also achieves the complexity reduction with respect to the prior schemes.

AB  - Narrowband active noise control (ANC, NANC) systems have been developed for attenuating noises that are generated by rotating machines such as motors, cutting machines, diesel engines, fans, etc. The conventional feedforward NANC systems adopt a non-acoustic sensor to detect and extract the noise signal frequencies for creating the reference sine and cosine waves, leading to high implementation cost as well as performance degradation due to frequency mismatch (FM). In this paper, we propose a new efficient feedback NANC system where an adaptive notch filter bank is utilized to construct the reference sinusoidal signals for the ANC system controller that consists of multiple two-weight magnitude/phase adjusters (MPA). The proposed system is also equipped with an online secondary-path modeling (SPM) subsystem that is capable of compensating the secondary-path drift. Extensive simulations are conducted to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed system.

AB  - The harmonic reducer is a key component of the industrial robot. Its reliability has significant influence on the consecutive operation of the industrial robot. However, its failure rate is high due to the complicated internal structure and long-term working conditions of large load and high torque. To identify the fault type of the harmonic reducer under different working conditions, this article proposes the joint wavelet regional correlation threshold denoising (WRCTD) algorithm and convolutional neural network-long short term memory (CNN-LSTM) fault detection method. Firstly, the WRCTD algorithm utilizes the regional correlation of the wavelet decomposition coefficients and the  $3\sigma $  criterion to suppress noise in the raw sensor data. Then, the CNN-LSTM model could mine hidden features of the processed sensor data to identify fault correctly. To evaluate the proposed method, the vibration signals of the harmonic reducer under different working conditions are collected by establishing a test rig. Comparative experimental results show that the proposed WRCTD algorithm can significantly improve the accuracy of the fault detection method. The specific values for the CNN-LSTM method and the LSTM method are 9.5% and 12.2%, respectively. In addition, the proposed CNN-LSTM method has better performance than traditional methods. It achieves the fault detection over 94.0%, which is 1.5%, 2.0%, 2.0%, 1.9%, and, 1.9% higher than the highest accuracy values of CNN, LSTM, and SVM methods in five experiments.

AB  - This research proposes a single-sensor acoustic emission (AE) scheme for detection and localization of crack in steel rail (rail head, rail web, and rail foot) under load. In the operation, AE signals were captured by the AE sensor and converted into digital signal data by AE data acquisition module. The digital data were used total variation denoising (TVD) algorithm to remove ambient and wheel/rail contact noises, and the denoised data were processed and classified to localize cracks in the steel rail using a deep learning algorithmic model. The AE signals of pencil lead break at the head, web, and foot of steel rail were used to train (80 % of the input data) and test (20%) the algorithmic model. In training and testing the algorithm, the AE signals were divided into two groupings (150 and 300 AE signals) and the classification accuracy compared. The deep learning-based AE scheme was also implemented on-site to detect cracks in the steel rail. The total accuracy under the first and second groupings were 86.6 % and 96.6 %. The novelty of this research lies in the use of single AE sensor and AE signal-driven deep learning algorithm to detect and localize cracks in the steel rail, unlike conventional AE crack-localization technology which relies on two or more sensors and human interpretation.

Improved fast Fourier transform is used to extract the characteristics of fiber vibration signal. In the part of data processing, the train track is trained by the algorithm of vibration band search, judgment and correction. The data fitting method is used to predict the track of the train with too much disturbance. A data-driven method is used to set the adaptive threshold to deal with the nonlinear problem of optical fiber signals. The simulation part verifies the feasibility of the algorithm.

AB  - Frequency modulated continuous wave radar systems are a common component of many driver assistance systems. Modern radar systems are heavily used for fast and reliable surrounding area sensing in both safety and automated driving applications. Recently a lot of of neural networks have been introduced for real time detection and classification of vulnerable road users without the need for traditional radar signal processing. One of these systems is based on the real-time object detection system YOLO (You Only Look Once) applied to the pre-processed radar range-Doppler-angle power spectrum. Therefore, the radar cube data is interpreted as a digital image for the computer-vision based YOLO algorithm. This paper deals with the possibility to increase performance of this algorithm, especially in noisy environments, by adding a denoising autoencoder (DAE) structure to the neural network. The DAE input is the noisy radar sensor data represented as an image. Adapted from computer vision applications, the DAE is trained to reconstruct an uncorrupted representation of the input data and hence reduces the noise effects from the measurement data. Furthermore, the domain adaptation capability of the neural network is researched, using simulated measurement data to improve training.

AB  - It is the main challenge for Global Positioning System (GPS)/Inertial Navigation System (INS) to achieve reliable and low-cost positioning solutions during GPS outages. A new GPS/INS hybrid method is proposed to bridge GPS outages. Firstly, a data pre-processing algorithm based on empirical mode decomposition (EMD) for wavelet de-noising is developed to reduce the uncertain noise of IMU raw measurements and provide accurate information for subsequent GPS/INS data fusion and training samples. Then, the interactive multi-model extended Kalman filter(IMM-EKF) algorithm is proposed to improve the robustness of Kalman filter output and the accuracy of model training target output. Finally, a new intelligent structure of GPS/INS based on Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is proposed. When the GPS is available, the IMM-EKF is used to fuse the GPS and de-noised INS data, and the de-noised INS data and the outputs of IMM-EKF are used to train the ELM. During GPS outages, the ELM is used to predict and correct the INS position error. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, 3 tests were performed in the actual field test. The comparison results show that the proposed fusion method can significantly improve the accuracy and reliability of positioning during GPS outages.

AB  - The development of the industrial Internet of Things paradigm brings forth the possibility of a significant transformation within the manufacturing industry. This paradigm is based on sensing large amounts of data, so that it can be employed by intelligent control systems (i.e., artificial intelligence algorithms) eliciting optimal decisions in real time. Ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the intelligent wireless sensing and control system pipeline is crucial toward achieving this goal. Nevertheless, the presence of noise in actual wireless transmission processes considerably affects the quality of the sensed data. Typically, noise and anomalies present in the data are very difficult to distinguish from each other. Conventional anomaly-detection techniques generate many error reports, which cause the control systems to issue incorrect responses that hinder the industrial production. In this article, a novel solution is proposed to denoise data while simultaneously preserving the actual anomalies. The proposed approach operates by measuring both the neighbor and background contrasts in computing a noise score. The trust level of each data point is then calculated through a correlation measure to purge spurious data. Extensive experiments on real datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach yields effective performance, as compared to existing methods, and it meets the requirements of low latency—facilitating the normal operation of the monitored control systems.

Since multiple sensors can be installed on the train to obtain real-time data, information fusion is a promising method that can be used to combine each sensor's unique information to calculate the stable and accurate localization results. A multi-sensor based localization system for the train autonomous control is proposed in this paper, which contains the Global Positioning System, Inertial Navigation System and velocity sensor. Covariance Intersection algorithm is proposed to integrate the output results of each sensor. Besides, considering the variety of the train running environment, adaptive Kalman filter is applied to reduce the impact of environmental noise. Finally, simulation results prove the proposed method in this paper improves the positioning accuracy compared with the traditional methods.

AB  - In recent years, with the development of hyper-velocity weapon, the research focus of penetration effect has switched gradually from high-velocity to hyper-velocity, with insufficient studies on penetration effect and its internal mechanism. Besides, the study on penetration effect of hyper-velocity weapon depends on the measurement of mechanical signal during penetration of projectile. In this paper, dynamic test of hyper-velocity impact penetration acceleration signal is studied in depth. Firstly, the penetration velocity and acceleration of projectile under the impact load are analyzed, the influence of the movement of the testing unit on the measured acceleration signal is studied, and the factors to be considered when measuring the hyper-velocity impact load are given. Further, this paper designs a measurement circuit and dynamic models of each measurement module, details the influence of dynamic characteristics of power delivery network on test accuracy, and provides a method to obtain dynamic characteristics of power delivery network by virtue of S parameter. Finally, to extract the real penetration overload signal, a superior noise reduction algorithm adopting Modified Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (MEEMD) is proposed, taking dynamic uncertainty and degree of approximation as evaluation indicators, and the measured sensor data is analyzed and processed with the proposed superior noise reduction algorithm. The experiment results show that, this method has a better noise reduction effect, and can be adopted to effectively extract real penetration overload signal. The results have theoretical research and application value to evaluate the reasonableness and effectiveness of measurement method of hyper-velocity penetration overload signal, and seek for a superior processing method for the noisy penetration overload signal.

AB  - Dynamic Vision Sensor (DVS) event camera output includes uninformative background activity (BA) noise events that increase dramatically under dim lighting. Existing denoising algorithms are not effective under these high noise conditions. Furthermore, it is difficult to quantitatively compare algorithm accuracy. This paper proposes a novel framework to better quantify BA denoising algorithms by measuring receiver operating characteristics with known mixtures of signal and noise DVS events. New datasets for stationary and moving camera applications of DVS in surveillance and driving are used to compare 3 new low-cost algorithms: Algorithm 1 checks distance to past events using a tiny fixed size window and removes most of the BA while preserving most of the signal for stationary camera scenarios. Algorithm 2 uses a memory proportional to the number of pixels for improved correlation checking. Compared with existing methods, it removes more noise while preserving more signal. Algorithm 3 uses a lightweight multilayer perceptron classifier driven by local event time surfaces to achieve the best accuracy over all datasets. The code and data are shared with the paper as DND21.

AB  - The navigation algorithms which use inertial measurement units (IMUs), such as inertial navigation systems (INSs), always suffer from intrinsic accumulated errors. Bias in gyros induces a significant drift in navigation output especially when micro-electro-mechanical sensor (MEMS) type is used. This error has high- and low-frequency components. De-noising of the long-term error (LTE) (the low-frequency component) is more challenging due to undeterministic behavior and overlapping with carrier motion in the low-frequency band. In this article, a method for de-noising of long-term MEMS-based gyro is presented. In this approach, an auto-regressive (AR) model for the LTE is developed which is being used as the process part of a Kalman filter. To separate the low-band motion dynamic from LTE in the measurement part of the Kalman Filter, the last time epoch of gyro data is subtracted from the current time epoch (memory-based filter). Some static and dynamic experiments have been done for the algorithm evaluation. The static test shows the reduction of LTE by 50%. Also, the method is invoked in INS/Doppler velocity log (DVL) integrated navigation system as a gyro prefilter. The results show that drift and point-to-point final error in position are reduced between 4% and 70% by invoking the de-noising method for gyros.

AB  - In the safety protection system of the railway electric multiple unit (EMU), the safety of the running part is extremely important. The daily detection of the internal hazard defects of the wheels in the running parts relies on a professional trackside fault online diagnosis system based on the ultrasonic sensor probe array data. However, the on-line ultrasonic diagnosis of EMU wheels is usually accompanied by various interference noises. The defect echo signals collected by the sensor probe array are weak and are easily submerged by noise, which makes it impossible to perform effective defect identification. This paper proposes an improved threshold function to overcome the discontinuous shortcomings of the classical wavelet soft threshold function and hard threshold function in view of the non-stationary characteristics of the ultrasonic detection signal of the EMU wheels. This paper proposes a sine-type threshold processing function. It is characterized by adopting gradual compression processing to denoise the echo signal of the ultrasonic sensor probe array. In order to verify the validity, the continuity at the threshold is observed through the linear space vector signal, and the algorithm is simulated and tested through the three-dimensional Gaussian echo mathematical model of the ultrasonic signal and the measured ultrasonic envelope signal. Experimental results show that the improved threshold function can suppress the noise in the ultrasonic echo data, improve the signal-to-noise ratio, and retain the waveform characteristics of the defect signal, which is conducive to defect recognition.

AB  - Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have been increasingly applied for environmental monitoring in recent years. However, the sensor data drift is a serious issue affecting the reliability of monitoring system. Based on the assumption that the neighboring nodes have correlated measurements, this paper presents a novel algorithm using constrained extreme learning machine and Kalman filter (CELM-KF) for tracking and calibrating drift of sensor data. CELM-KF has two phases: training phase and calibrating phase. In the training phase, the wavelet denoising method is used for data preprocessing. Then the cluster head trains the model of the constrained extreme learning machine (CELM) using the measurements of its neighbors to obtain the prediction data of the target sensor. In the calibrating phase, we track and correct the data drift of target sensor using Kalman filter. To evaluate the performance of CELM-KF, simulation experiments on different datasets are conducted, and two parameters including decision coefficient and mean square error (MSE) of CELM-KF are compared with those of existing algorithms. The simulation results show that CELM-KF can successfully calibrate the sensor data drifts.

AB  - Recently, the colloidal quantum dot spectrometer has received much attention due to its advantages in cost, size, and operation. Yet, just like many other filter-based miniature spectrometers, spectrum reconstruction for the colloidal quantum dot spectrometer is typically prone to the measurement noise due to the correlation of the filters. In this paper, we propose an effective spectrum reconstruction method for the colloidal quantum dot spectrometer, which can recover high-quality spectra in noisy environments. Specifically, we employ a denoising autoencoder, a machine-learning approach, to reduce noise in the filters' raw measurements before performing the reconstruction. After that, we reconstruct the spectra with the denoised data by a sparse recovery algorithm. We investigate the feasibility of the proposed reconstruction approach on a synthetic dataset and an experimental dataset collected by the colloidal quantum dot spectrometer. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach could deliver accurate reconstruction results even when data are corrupted with the measurement noise.

AB  - Telemonitoring of diaphragmatic electromyogram (EMGdi) signal in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and Internet of Things (IoT) holds the promise to be an evolving direction in personalized medicine. The WSNs and IoT enable EMGdi information telemonitoring and communications technologies play important roles in the process of personal medical care, especially for the respiratory diseases. However, while designing such a system, one should consider the required functionality, miniaturization, energy efficiency, etc., to make fewer resources required in WSNs and IoT. Conventional methods of data acquisition cannot energy-effectively compress data with reduced device costs. Different from the traditional compression methods, compressed sensing (CS) takes promising steps toward these challenges. Unfortunately, EMGdi is not sparse in time domain. Hence, current CS algorithms are extremely difficult to use directly for recovering EMGdi. In order to satisfy the requirements of applications of personal medical care in WSNs and IoT, this study proposes an approximated ι0 norm based method to search the solution via the gradient descent method, then projects the searched solution to the reconstruction feasible set. Meanwhile, this study adopts a new wavelet threshold based method to denoise the electrocardiographic interference. Experimental results are provided to testify the performance of the proposed methods.

AB  - We propose and experimentally demonstrate a scheme for accelerated fast BOTDA. The effect of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) on recovery performance of compressed sensing is simulated and analyzed, it is found that a reduction in SNR requires much larger frequency data to recover the original Brillouin gain spectrum (BGS). To enable a high recovery probability, Block-Matching and 3D filtering (BM3D) algorithm is employed to enhance the SNR of Brillouin time trace and reduce the number of averages. Combining with a principal component analysis (PCA) based compressed sensing technique, the Brillouin gain spectrum (BGS) can be successfully reconstructed from only 37.5% frequency data. In the experiment, 75 randomly selected frequency data is acquired to reconstruct the BGS. Distributed strain sensing is achieved over 15 km single-mode fiber with 3 m spatial resolution and 0.52 MHz Brillouin frequency shift (BFS) uncertainty. Due to the accelerated process, the measurement time with 40 averages is less than 0.5 s.

AB  - The presence of rain can negatively affect the performance of many sensors such as X-band radar. In this paper, an effective approach is proposed to mitigate the effect of rain on significant wave height ( ${H}_{s}$ ) estimation from X-band radar sensor data along with a machine-learning (ML)-based method. First of all, the haze removal algorithm is applied to rain-contaminated radar images as pre-processing. Then, three different features are extracted from the processed radar images. Different combinations of these three features are utilized to estimate  ${H}_{s}$  under the rain condition by using support vector regression (SVR)-based and temporal convolutional network (TCN)-based regression methods. It is found that the root-mean-square-errors (RMSEs) of  ${H}_{s}$  estimation results using two typical methods (signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)-based and ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD)-based linear fitting methods) are decreased by 0.14 m and 0.48 m after introducing the haze removal algorithm, respectively. Also, a relatively high accuracy can be achieved using the SVR-based regression method with the combination of SNR and gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) features. Compared to the SNR-based and EEMD-based linear regression methods, the proposed SVR-based method further improves the estimation accuracy, with reductions of RMSE by 0.19 m and 0.82 m, respectively.

AB  - This paper presents an algorithm developed to detect and locate Partial Discharge (PD) signals in generators using wavelet transform techniques. The signals obtained from the sensors in the generator are de-noised by Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). The original signal is decomposed into high and low frequencies to assist in the elimination of noise. The filtered signal is passed through a localisation process utilising the continuous wavelet transform (CWT), which will be shown in the time-frequency domain. The signals obtained at locations in the time domain can be analysed to determine their frequency content allowing a comparison of their characteristics to the standards of partial discharges in generators. The experimental results indicate that the proposed technique could efficiently decrease noise through application of the Daubechies 4 (Daub4) as a mother wavelet and lowering the signal to level 12. The results also show that this condition could lead to accurate performance in locating the time of the signal and determining the frequency of the PD signal via the CWT.

AB  - Industrial Internet-of-Things (IIoT) applications require reliable and efficient wireless communication. Assuming dense wireless sensor networks (WSNs) operating in a harsh environment, a concept of a time-division multiple access (TDMA)-based WSN enriched with electronically steerable parasitic array radiator (ESPAR) antennas is proposed and examined in this work. The utilized antenna provides one omnidirectional and 12 directional radiation patterns that can be electronically switched by the sensor node. We introduce a relay discovery algorithm, which selects those sensor nodes with an ESPAR antenna capable to act as relay. The selection of the relay nodes is based on a certain link quality threshold that algorithm uses as input. The outcome is a reduction in the number of layers or hops with a guaranteed Quality of Service (QoS). To emphasize the physical aspect of the wireless propagation, we introduce the measured antenna radiation patterns and consider two different path-loss propagation models representing blockage-free and blockage-prone industrial environments. A number of network simulations were performed and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as a link quality measure was examined with respect to the network density and different measured radiation pattern settings. The main outcomes show a tradeoff between SNR per link and the percentage of nodes that can serve as relays. As a result, we propose network design guidelines that take under consideration the QoS range with respect to SNR together with an optimal number of antenna radiation patterns that should be selected as a tradeoff between latency, energy consumption, and reliability in a network.

AB  - At present, there is only one image sensor and a color filter array covering its surface to collect color images in most imaging devices. Each pixel of the collected color image can only obtain one color component from digital image sensor directly, and the other two color missing components need to be calculated through color interpolation. Since Bayer-type color filter array widely used in various kinds of sensors has good color signal sensitivity and color recovery characteristic, we reconstruct the two missing color components in Bayer mode images in this paper according to it. Two Color Interpolation algorithms widely used in digital imaging devices are introduced in detail in this paper, Gradient Edge-oriented (GEO) Interpolation Algorithm and Adaptive Color Plane (ACP) Interpolation Algorithm, and then we present a modified adaptive Color layer Interpolation Algorithm based on them. In the experiments, 10 images are selected from the IVC database. 40 sets of data are generated from the images and then they are used to analyze from Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR), Structural Similarity (SSIM), Feature Similarity (FSIM) and Computing Time quality metrics to study the quality of the 10 images after the processing of interpolation. This four metrics are the basis of judging the processing effect of MACP, GEO and ACP algorithms. The results of the experiments show that Modified adaptive Color plane (MACP) algorithm can solve the contradiction effectively between the reconstruction of high-quality color images and reduction of computational complexity, and improve the processing speed of color image reconstruction exactly.

AB  - Most existing source-oriented image and video clustering algorithms based on sensor pattern noise (SPN) rely on the pairwise similarities, whose calculation usually dominates the overall computational time. The heavy computational burden is mainly incurred by the high dimensionality of SPN, which typically goes up to millions for delivering plausible clustering performance. This problem can be further aggravated by the uncertainty of the orientation of images or videos because the spatial correspondence between data with uncertain orientations needs to be reestablished in a brute-force search manner. In this work, we propose a rotation-invariant binary representation of SPN to address the issue of rotation and reduce the computational cost of calculating the pairwise similarities. Results on two public multimedia forensics databases have shown that the proposed approach is effective in overcoming the rotation issue and speeding up the calculation of pairwise SPN similarities for source-oriented image and video clustering.

AB  - Due to the continuous improvement of solid-state lighting technologies, multispectrum, multicolor LEDs have been used as transmitters for wavelength division multiplexing visible light communication (WDM-VLC) techniques. Although the multispectrum LEDs can emit light with different wavelengths for multichannel transmission, the overlapped spectra across the WDM channels could cause high interband multichannel interferences (IBMCI). Accordingly, the large-scale filter-array detectors (LFDs) have been adopted to WDM-VLC techniques and shown high capability for the IBMCI rejection using the maximum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) combining (MSC) method. However, in the MSC method, it requires 100% filter array usage ratio, which would potentially result in costly computational complexity. In this paper, we propose two approaches, namely, conjugate gradient (CG) algorithm approach and binary particle swarm optimization (BPSO) algorithm approach, for sparse filter selection. According to both simulation and experimental results, the proposed CG algorithm approach can significantly reduce the filter array usage ratio by up to 70% while maintaining a good detector output SINR. The proposed BPSO algorithm approach can provide a near optimal detector output SINR while maintaining a good reduction of filter array usage ratio.

AB  - As a kind of widely used switchgear in power system, the reliability of gas insulated switchgear (GIS) is very important for the safe operation of power systems. However, there is a lack of research on intelligent detection technology of mechanical state of GIS at present. A new method is urgently needed to improve the operability, effectiveness, and accuracy of fault detection in GIS. Aiming at the abnormal vibration signals generated by GIS faults, this article presents a fault diagnosis method (GA-DBSCAN) consisting of a feature selection method based on genetic algorithm (GA) and Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN), and a fault diagnosis method based on DBSCAN. First, this article analyzes the incentive force of GIS and discusses the characteristic frequency of response signal combining with the non-linear characteristics of a GIS system. Second, GA and DBSCAN are used to screen features for dimension reduction and get the optimized feature space, and DBSCAN-based classification is used to classify faults. Finally, optimized feature space is verified to be superior to the original feature space by typical classification method; the superiority and reliability of DBSCAN-based classification method under optimized feature space is verified by comparing with other classification methods. The proposed GA-DBSCAN approach can substantially increase the performance of the fault diagnosis method, which indicates that the method promotes development of intelligent detection technology of mechanical state in GIS.

AB  - In-sensor energy-efficient deep learning accelerators have the potential to enable the use of deep neural networks in embedded vision applications. However, their negative impact on accuracy has been severely underestimated. The inference pipeline used in prior in-sensor deep learning accelerators bypasses the image signal processor (ISP), thereby disrupting the conventional vision pipeline and undermining accuracy of machine learning algorithms trained on conventional, post-ISP datasets. For example, the detection accuracy of an off-the-shelf Faster RCNN algorithm in a vehicle detection scenario reduces by 60%. To make in-sensor accelerators practical, we describe energy-efficient operations that yield most of the benefits of an ISP and reduce covariate shift between the training (ISP processed images) and target (RAW images) distributions. For the vehicle detection problem, our approach improves accuracy by 25-60%. Relative to the conventional ISP pipeline, energy consumption and response time improve by 30% and 34%, respectively.

AB  - High-G MEMS accelerometer (HGMA) is widely used in the aerospace field and the precise control of missiles. Therefore, its calibration accuracy is critical to sensor performance and the overall control system. In order to decrease the influence of noise on the HGMA output signal, a hybrid denoising algorithm which is based on the Time-frequency peak filtering (TFPF), Local mean decomposition (LMD) and Sample entropy (SE) has been proposed in this article. For the problem that the TFPF algorithm is limited in the choice of window length, LMD and SE are used to distinguish components, which can improve the TFPF algorithm effectively. It provides a better balance between noise reduction and signal fidelity. Firstly, the noise-containing signal can be decomposed by LMD to obtain PFs. Secondly, calculate the sample entropy values of each PFs, then divide the signal into mixed component, useful component and noise component according to the similarity of sample entropy. Thirdly, the mixed component can use long-window TFPF to reduce noise, the short-window TFPF can reduce the noise for the useful component, and the noise component can be wiped off directly. Finally, the useful component and the mixed component are both reconstructed to form the final denoised signal. Experiments have showed that this method can not only remove noise (the noise of static signal is reduced by 91.76%, the signal-noise ratio of dynamic signal has increased to 17.6), but also retain the details of frequency and amplitude (the shock peak amplitude error is 0.062% and the vibration amplitude error is 0.04%). Therefore, this method can reduce the noise of the High-G MEMS accelerometer signal with maintaining the characteristics of the original signal, thereby greatly improves the performance of the accelerometer, making it widely used.

AB  - In this paper, we consider fast wireless data aggregation via over-the-air computation (AirComp) in Internet of Things (IoT) networks, where an access point (AP) with multiple antennas aim to recover the arithmetic mean of sensory data from multiple IoT devices. To minimize the estimation distortion, we formulate a mean-squared-error (MSE) minimization problem that involves the joint optimization of the transmit scalars at the IoT devices as well as the denoising factor and the receive beamforming vector at the AP. To this end, we derive the transmit scalars and the denoising factor in closed-form, resulting in a non-convex quadratic constrained quadratic programming (QCQP) problem concerning the receive beamforming vector. Different from the existing studies that only obtain sub-optimal beamformers, we propose a branch and bound (BnB) algorithm to design the globally optimal receive beamformer. Extensive simulations demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed algorithm in terms of MSE. Moreover, the proposed BnB algorithm can serve as a benchmark to evaluate the performance of the existing sub-optimal algorithms.

AB  - The detection of wafer faults in early process steps through monitoring and analyzing multivariate process trace data contribute to wafer yield improvements. Standard classification algorithms have been generally used for fault detection and classification (FDC). However, this approach can cause information loss while extracting statistical features from the trace data and cannot consider class imbalance situations where much fewer faulty wafers are generated than normal wafers. In addition, the approach does not consider normal wafer-to-wafer (W2W) variations and sensor noise inherent in the trace data. These drawbacks significantly degrade FDC performance. This paper proposes a method that builds an FDC model only with trace data of normal wafers in which W2W variations and sensor noise exist. The one-class FDC method detects the occurrence of abnormal trace patterns that cause wafer faults by removing W2W variations and sensor noise from raw traces by using denoising autoencoders, and this method finds the fault-introducing process parameters with the occurrence times. In experiments using the trace data of etch and chemical vapor deposition processes, the proposed method exhibited 1% and 6% higher performance than the best-performing method among comparison methods in terms of the geometric mean of the normal and fault detection accuracies.

AB  - This chapter discusses the study of the signal enhancement problem in the frequency domain with a single sensor. In many respects, the frequency domain approach is equivalent to the spectral method. The advantages of the frequency‐domain technique are twofold. First, it is very flexible, in the sense that the observation signal at each frequency can be processed independently of the others. Second, all algorithms can be implemented very efficiently by using the fast Fourier transform. The chapter starts by formulating the problem. It then explains how to perform noise reduction with just simple gains. The chapter gives all kinds of optimal gains derivation results and shows how one can compromise between distortion of the desired signal and reduction of the additive noise. It also explains how these gains can be implemented in the short‐time Fourier transform domain. Finally, the chapter gives all relevant performance measures.

AB  - Distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) technology is a rapidly evolving fiber-optic sensing technology that has been gradually applied to vertical seismic profile (VSP) data. The DAS VSP data are often contaminated by multiple interference waves, such as random noise, coupled noise, horizontal noise, and the existing methods can only map it from noisy data to effective reflections. However, interference waves are also a relative concept, and many interference waves still have certain application values. Therefore, this article proposes an innovative algorithm called attribute-guided target data separation network (Att-TDSN), which can not only complete the conventional signal-noise separation task but also achieve noise-noise separation task. Specifically, we first propose a flexible and efficient training set, namely, multidimensional weak label training set (Mul-WLTS), which introduces attribute features as the weak labels and specifies the dimension of weak labels according to the number of target data types (effective reflections and several common interference waves). Then, we use the weak labels to guide our network to map training data to specified data types, assisting the network to focus its attention on each kind of target data. Finally, the network parameters are trained by a training mode called “one-way matching and two-way constraint.” “One-way matching” makes data separation result unique, and “two-way constraint” can improve the algorithm’s amplitude preserving ability. Experiments on synthetic and field DAS VSP data show that our network can accurately separate target data. Moreover, for the traditional denoising task, Att-TDSN also has a better denoising performance than existing methods.

AB  - Sensors typically record their measurements using more precision than the accuracy of the sensing techniques. Thus, experimental and observational data often contains noise that appears random and cannot be easily compressed. This noise increases storage requirement as well as computation time for analyses. In this work, we describe a line of research to develop data reduction techniques that preserve the key features while reduce the storage requirement. Our core observation is that the noise in such cases could be characterized by a small number of patterns based on statistical similarity. In earlier tests, this approach was shown to reduce the storage requirement by over 100-fold for one-dimensional sequences. In this work, we explore a set of different similarity measures for multidimensional sequences. During our tests with standard quality measures such as PSNR, we see that the new compression methods reduce the storage requirements over 100-fold while maintaining relatively low errors in peak signal-to-noise ratio. Thus, we believe that this is a new and effective way of constructing data reduction techniques.

AB  - Advanced image sensors with high resolution are now being developed for specially purposed electro-optical systems, with research focused on robust image quality performance in terms of super resolution and noise removal under various environmental conditions. Recently, machine-learning and deep-learning methods have been studied as the best practical techniques for restoration to improve the deteriorated image quality of sensors. However, these methods show limitations and side effects of image degradation such as image non-uniformity. In this paper, we analyze and randomly generate additive white Gaussian noise, non-uniform line noise, and dark saturation as representative image degradations. We then propose an advanced U-net model based on global and local residual learning in order to restore complexly deteriorated images. The proposed method shows unparalleled performance compared to alternative models and previous studies. In particular, various complex noise components are minimized and improved with equal quality so that variation between sequential images is minimized. These findings leverage mutual corroboration of quantitative and qualitative evaluation metrics. In the future, the proposed model is expected to contribute to a wide range of field applications such as defense, surveillance, and video media for image quality enhancement technologies.

AB  - In the radio channels of cellular networks, signals generally propagate through multiple paths in scattering environments. Multipath Components (MPCs) are shown to be distributed in different groups, known as clusters, in Channel Impulse Responses (CIRs). Clustering MPCs is a critical step in channel measurement and modeling. Many clustering algorithms have been proposed but few of them are able to handle noise effectively. In this paper, we propose a de-noising MPC-clustering framework based on a new Space-Transformed Fuzzy c-Means (ST-FCM) algorithm and the fusion of channel measurement snapshots. ST-FCM solves the issue that the Multipath Component Distance that quantifies the similarity among MPCs cannot be adopted in the conventional FCM algorithm. Then we apply the Dempster-Shafer evidence theory to fuse the clustering results of multiple snapshots, which can detect and remove noise by making a full use of all the measurement data. Furthermore, we design a censoring process for hard partition and a validation process to determine the optimal number of clusters. We have performed extensive simulations on MPC clustering using the CIRs generated by the Third Generation Partnership Project 3-dimensional channel models. We also have developed a space-time channel sounder and have performed experiments in a typical rural macrocell scenario. The simulation and experiment results have shown that the proposed framework has a better performance in clustering accuracy than the current methods.

AB  - Detecting and tracking moving targets is a challenging task, which becomes even harder in underwater scenarios due to the extremely low levels of signal-to-noise ratio associated with common acoustic measures. In the context of continuous marine monitoring, a further challenge is provided by the need to deploy computationally efficient methods that guarantee minimum use of power resources in off-shore monitoring platforms. Here we present a novel approach to accurately detect and track moving targets from the reflections of an active acoustic emitter. Our system is based on a computationally- and energy-efficient deep convolutional denoising autoencoder. System performance is evaluated both on simulated and emulated data, and benchmarked against a probabilistic tracking method based on the Viterbi algorithm.

AB  - In this article, a new Kurtosis based deflation Independent Component Analysis (ICA) algorithm is proposed. Contrary to conventional Kurtosis based deflation ICA algorithms where the separator vector is obtained by optimizing a given Kurtosis-based objective function using gradient-like approaches, the proposed algorithm performs a component-wise optimization of this separator vector through an alternating maximization strategy. This leads to an exact computation of each component of the separator vector by simply rooting a 4-th order polynomial derived from the objective function. The good performance of the proposed algorithm is confirmed and compared to two well known ICA algorithms, namely FastICA and RobustICA.

AB  - This paper describes a blind transmitter localization technique based on the deep neural network (DNN) framework. Blind localization assumes no previous knowledge on the transmit signal. It is shown that DNN based location approaches the maximum likelihood solution with reduced computational complexity. Moreover, the maximum likelihood, least squares and radio environment map localization estimators are presented in order to compare the design and performance of the proposed DNN algorithm. The system model is built based on a wireless sensor network that collects received signal strength measurements assuming disturbances of distance dependent correlated shadowing noise. Performance evaluation using numerical simulations shows that the proposed DNN scheme achieves location accuracy similar to the optimum maximum likelihood estimator while presenting computational complexity reduction of more than 90%.

AB  - A novel fusion algorithm is proposed based on Improved Adaptive Wavelet Threshold De-noising (IAWTD), C-means Support Vector Machine (CSVM) and Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) method to eliminate the humidity drift of MEMS gyroscope. Firstly, the IAWTD method is employed to decrease the humidity drift component in MEMS gyroscope output signal. Then, the humidity drift compensation model is established: the input elements are the relative humidity, the change rate of relative humidity and the humidity drift, and the output is the compensated MEMS gyroscope output signal by EEMD method. In order to verify the compensation effect of the fusion algorithm, the gyroscope outputs are collected and analyzed with the relative humidity ranged from 40% to 90% based on the temperature varying from 20°C to 60°C. The results show that the IAWTD-CSVM-EEMD method significantly reduces the influence of relative humidity drift on the gyroscope output, according to the quantitative analysis of Allan variance, the quantization noise of the gyroscope output decreases by 87.78%, 96.37%, 97.77%, 99.17% and 92.62% respectively under the relative humidity ranging from 40% to 90%, as the temperature rose from 20 °C to 60 °C at intervals of 10 °C. In addition, the bias stability decreases by 96.9%, 99.41%, 99.1%, 99.46%, and 99.78% respectively and the angle random walk decreases by 88.16%, 96.54%, 98.16%, 94.43%, and 92.05% respectively at different temperatures. It is worth mentioning that, to further verify the applicability of the fusion algorithm, a group of comparative experiments are added to consider the influence of temperature changes on the gyroscope output under different relative humidity. The experimental results show that the quantization noise, bias stability and angle random walk of the MEMS gyroscope are significantly reduced compared with the original output after processing by IAWTD-CSVM-EEMD. Therefore, the method proposed in this paper is beneficial to reduce the humidity drift in the MEMS gyroscope output.

AB  - With the development of information technology and network technology, as well as sensing technology, more and more data are collected from the processing of producing and machining in industrial sites. Industrial data are usually with noises and errors because the interference of ambient and the fault of sensors. Data preprocessing is necessary for analyzing further. The local polynomial regression is usually used to data denoising because of its characters of simplicity and flexibility, but the smoothing parameter of this algorithm need to be manually set by trial and error. In this paper, an adaptive parameter optimization method is used to calibrate its parameter, that is, the multi-indicator fusion method is used to fuse the root mean square error (RMSE), signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and smoothness (r) of the denoised signal into a composite evaluation indicator. The smoothing parameter corresponding to the minimum value of the indicator is the optimal smoothing parameter of the denoising algorithm. A data set which is collected from monitoring the temperature field and thermal error of a heavy-duty CNC machine tool is used to validate the method.

AB  - Many point cloud acquisition methods, e.g. multi-viewpoint image stereo matching and acquisition of depth data from active light sensors, suffer from significant geometry noise in the data. In the existing literature, denoising of this geometry noise has been performed using only geometry information. In this paper, based on the notion that color attributes are correlated with the geometry, we propose a novel geometry denoising technique that takes advantage of this correlation via a graph-based optimization process. In particular, we construct a graph based on both color and geometry information, and use it for graph-based Tikhonov regularization. Results on synthetic and real-world point clouds show that the proposed denoising method significantly outperforms existing geometry-only techniques.

AB  - The raw vibration signal of rolling element bearing carrying a great deal of information representing the mechanical equipment's health conditions, but the impulsive signal of interest (SOI) is usually hidden in heavy noise, and denoising technique is great significant to the fault diagnosis. High resolution time-frequency algorithms, such as the wavelet based synchrosqueezing transform, have a wide range of applications in removing noise, and multichannel sensor technology has highlighted the requirement for multivariate denoising. In this paper, a multivariate wavelet denoising method based on synchrosqueezing is proposed. The mutual modulated oscillations of multivariate data is identified by partitioning the time-frequency domain, and a modified universal threshold is employed to remove the noise components while to retain SOI.

AB  - This article presents a reconfigurable processor based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm for reconstructing compressively sensed physiological signals. The architecture is flexible to support physiological ExG [electrocardiography (ECG), electromyography (EMG), and electroencephalography (EEG)] signal with various signal dimensions (128, 256, 384, and 512). Data characteristics are utilized to substantially reduce the overall hardware complexity by up to 99%. A 16× folded architecture achieves a 64% area-power product reduction compared with the unfolded one. A customized buffer is used for multi-word access, which reduces data latency by four times. It dissipates 75% less power with only 25% area when compared with the realization with conventional flip-flops. As a proof of concept, a reconfigurable processor for reconstructing ExG signals is presented. Fabricated in a 40-nm CMOS technology, the processor integrates 3.69-M gates in 3.23 mm2. The chip delivers a throughput of 573-2901 kSamples/s (kS/s) for ExG signals and dissipates less than 12.6 mW at 87 MHz from a 0.60-V supply. Compared with state-of-the-art designs, the chip achieves a 1.5-to-14× higher throughput with 3.2-to-11× less energy, given the performance specification [reconstruction signal-to-noise ratio (RSNR) ≥ 15 dB].

AB  - The spatial resolution of hyperspectral sensor is limited and the surface features are complicated, and each pixel contains more material information, resulting in the existence of a large number of mixed pixels. Therefore, the research on endmember extraction method have been becoming a hotspot in the hyperspectral field. The extraction method which is based on specificity analysis is greatly influenced by abnormal points in the image. This paper mainly combines the pixels' density with distance statistics to analyze different types ofpixels, and then use distribution statistic information to remove the interference of pixels with abnormal properties. On this basis, ATGP, VCA, SGA and NMF are used respectively to conduct the endmember extraction, and then analyze and study the accuracy of the endmember extraction algorithm combining with distribution statistics. Then the validity of this algorithm is verified by simulating hyperspectral images and real hyperspectral images.

AB  - Vibration signals acquired by accelerometers are commonly used in the field of bearing fault diagnosis. The measured vibration signals contain a series of impulse responses when localized bearing faults occur. These impulses are often viewed as fault features and exhibit nonlocal self-similarity in terms of morphological characteristics. However, the impulses are generally contaminated by background noise. In this paper, a group-based K-SVD denoising algorithm, which exploits the nonlocal self-similarity property, is presented to extract bearing fault features. In contrast to regular K-SVD denoising, this denoising algorithm forms groups by clustering similar signal segments and regards each group rather than each segment as the basic unit of sparse representation. To group similar segments, we further propose a particular grouping method that exploits bearing prior knowledge (i.e., possible impulse spacings). The new grouping method could form groups in a targeted manner, thereby achieving more accurate grouping. Group-based K-SVD denoising is able to extract fault features better as similar segments collaboratively provide a large amount of shared feature information, especially in the presence of strong noise (such as signal-to-noise ratios lower than -10 dB). The numerical and experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of group-based K-SVD denoising over regular K-SVD denoising and other two benchmark algorithms (i.e., wavelet shrinkage and spectral kurtosis).

AB  - Dynamic Vision Sensor (DVS) is a new type of neuromorphic event-based sensor, which has an innate advantage in capturing fast-moving objects. Due to the interference of DVS hardware itself and many external factors, noise is unavoidable in the output of DVS. Different from frame/image with structural data, the output of DVS is in the form of address-event representation (AER), which means that the traditional denoising methods cannot be used for the output (i.e., event stream) of the DVS. In this paper, we propose a novel event stream denoising method based on probabilistic undirected graph model (PUGM). The motion of objects always shows a certain regularity/trajectory in space and time, which reflects the spatio-temporal correlation between effective events in the stream. Meanwhile, the event stream of DVS is composed by the effective events and random noise. Thus, a probabilistic undirected graph model is constructed to describe such priori knowledge (i.e., spatio-temporal correlation). The undirected graph model is factorized into the product of the cliques energy function, and the energy function is defined to obtain the complete expression of the joint probability distribution. Better denoising effect means a higher probability (lower energy), which means the denoising problem can be transfered into energy optimization problem. Thus, the iterated conditional modes (ICM) algorithm is used to optimize the model to remove the noise. Experimental results on denoising show that the proposed algorithm can effectively remove noise events. Moreover, with the preprocessing of the proposed algorithm, the recognition accuracy on AER data can be remarkably promoted. The source code of the proposed method is available at https://web.xidian.edu.cn/wjj/paper.html.

AB  - Inertial measurement data holds an important role in inertial navigation. MEMS Inertial Measurement Units "IMUs" are used for inertial measurement in navigation, but these sensors suffer from a big amount of noise which makes the navigational solution degrade very fast with time. Many papers discuss the benefit of using Wavelet denoising, and some papers discuss the use of other filters such as Savitzky-Golay. The purpose of this paper is to examine the real benefit of using denoising techniques on modern MEMS IMUs and using multiple sources of data on multiple trajectories and scenarios, thus justifying the needed CPU cycles for the denoising task. We performed pure inertial navigation without any GNSS aid. Our results showed that the inertial navigation algorithm itself compensates for the type of noise that is usually removed by denoising techniques, and thus there is no need for any pre-filtering of MEMS IMU data using traditional methods.

AB  - Demosaicking and denoising are key steps in the camera imaging chain for both images and videos. The reconstruction errors during these stages will have undesirable effects on the final result if not handled properly. Demosaicking provokes the spatial and color correlation of noise, which is afterwards enhanced by the processing pipeline. This structured noise generally degrades the image quality and, for dark scenes with low signal to noise ratio, prevents the correct interpretation of the image. When trying to mitigate such structured noise on already processed data, denoising methods attenuate details and texture. We present a video processing chain, consisting of a novel strategy for the removal of noise at the camera sensor and a novel video demosaicking algorithm. In both cases, a spatio-temporal patch-based filter with motion compensation is introduced. The experimental results, including real examples, illustrate the performance of the proposed chain, avoiding the creation of interpolation artefacts and colored spots.

AB  - This paper presents the design and proposal of vehicle identification and classification sensing mechanism using fiber-optic distributed acoustic sensing (DAS). The seismic signatures of strategic-cum-domestic vehicles were made to interact with the embedded optical fibers and the acquired backscattered optical data was processed for feature extraction. The vehicle type was identified through the signal processing using a deep learning approach resulting in a novel and intelligent vehicle identification platform. Data denoising was performed using various time-series mining algorithms with at least 500 epochs to test the model accuracy. This fully automated and end-to-end simulated sensing system used an asymmetric generative adversarial network (GAN) for denoising the time series data resulting in the training and testing accuracy of 73.63% and 69.5% respectively. The model can also be employed to measure the real-time speed and position of the vehicle.

AB  - Separation of heart sound signals from the recorded mixtures has become a hot research topic in the clinical diagnosis of heart diseases. To better understand the current health status of patients, it is of great significance to develop intelligent auscultation methods to improve the effectiveness of hearing and assist clinicians in practice. In this paper, an optimization convolutive blind source separation algorithm utilizing independent vector analysis is proposed for separation of the heart sound mixtures. In the algorithm, a denoising approach is firstly used to reduce the impact of the additive white Gaussian noise. Then, using the short time Fourier transform, the mixing signals in time domain are transmitted into the frequency domain. Afterwards, the unmixng matrix is updated using Newton’s method, and the heart sound sources are reconstructed based on the estimated unmixing matrix. Experimental results show that the algorithm obtains better separation performance than the baseline methods. Especially, it has better superiority in the strong reverberant environment.

AB  - Acquired 3D point cloud data, whether from active sensors directly or from stereo-matching algorithms indirectly, typically contain non-negligible noise. To address the point cloud denoising problem, we propose a local graph-based algorithm. Specifically, given a $k$ -nearest-neighbor graph of the 3D points, we first approximate it with a bipartite graph (independent sets of red and blue nodes) using a KL divergence criterion. For each partite of nodes (say red), we first define surface normal of each red node using 3D coordinates of neighboring blue nodes, so that red node normals n can be written as a linear function of red node coordinates p. We then formulate a convex optimization problem, with a quadratic fidelity term $\Vert \mathbf{p}-\mathbf{q}\Vert_{2}^{2}$ given noisy observed red coordinates q and a graph total variation (GTV) regularization term for surface normals of neighboring red nodes. We minimize the resulting $l_{2}-l_{1}$-norm using alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and proximal gradient descent. The two partites of nodes are alternately optimized until convergence. Experimental results show that compared to state-of-the-art schemes with similar complexity, our proposed algorithm achieves the best overall denoising performance objectively and subjectively.

AB  - It is important to consider the peak-to-average-power ratio (PAPR) metric in discrete time radar waveform design for efficient use of the bounded energy budget. In previous literature, much consideration has been given to both the constant modulus and PAPR constrained waveform designs. However, in this approach, we show a straightforward methodology to design the transmit radar waveform to directly constrain PAPR while also considering prohibited bands for transmission (other users perhaps). Improvement in null-depth is observed for multiple design approaches, possibly enough to enable co-existence for radar and communications. Simulated and experimental results are given to corroborate the theoretical understanding.

AB  - Denoising, smoothing, missing data, and outlier issues that occur in many fields involve finding models for noise and data. However, the models often make assumptions of the noise, such as white noise, Gaussian noise, etc. Numerical methods [wavelets, Fourier transforms, Kalman filter, principal component analysis (PCA), etc.] are available for data conditioning. However, they suffer from inaccuracies. This paper presents a new approach, in which a hybrid physics-based model and deep physics neural network (DPNN) model are used to simultaneously build a data conditioning autoencoder (DPNNAE) based on DPNN for enhancing the signal strength, compared to a conventional autoencoder (AE). It necessitates integration of domain-specific physics-based models with a data-driven approach. A one-dimensional (1D) stochastic Burgers equation is used as a prototype for demonstrating the new algorithm but can be easily applied to other systems. This paper provides a new data conditioning approach that performs denoising, smoothing, data imputation, and outlier removal using DPNN and AE. This approach offers an improved and efficient methodology to arrive at the noise-free data and fills the missing data. During this work, the DPNN was applied to predict noise-free velocity in the unsteady viscous stochastic Burgers equation. The loss function is obtained from the physics models produced from domain insight and measured data. Thus, the deep neural network (DNN) framework integrates physics-based models into its framework. The hybrid DPNN model uses measured data from sensors; both measured data and physics are simultaneously satisfied by the model resulting in noise-free measured data. The conditioned data can be further used to build the DPNNAE model for further conditioning, and the DPNN can be used for filling the missing data. The DPNN method outperformed other common denoising algorithms. The new hybrid modeling data conditioning algorithm developed during this work can be applied to any real-time modeling system with real-time measurements for denoising.

AB  - Several noise reduction algorithms have been proposed for wireless acoustic sensor networks, which consist of spatially distributed nodes that are connected via a wireless link. To decrease the required bandwidth and computational complexity, in this paper we propose two iterative distributed maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimators. In the first scheme, each node sequentially updates its estimate, whereas in the second scheme, all nodes simultaneously update their estimates. Based on simulations in a reverberant room with three nodes, we have compared the noise reduction performance of the proposed distributed MAP estimators with the centralized MAP estimator, where each node has access to all signals, and the local MAP estimator, where each node only has access to its own signals. The simulation results show that the proposed distributed estimators result in a good noise reduction performance, while decreasing the computational complexity compared to the centralized estimator.

AB  - Automotive radar interference imposes big challenges on signal processing algorithms as it raises the noise floor and consequently lowers the detection probability. With limited frequency bands and increasing number of sensors per car, avoidance techniques such as frequency hopping or beamforming quickly become insufficient. Detect-and-repair strategies have been studied intensively for the automotive field, to reconstruct the affected signal samples. However depending on the type of interference, reconstruction of the time domain signals is a highly non-trivial task, which can affect following signal processing modules. In this work an autoencoder based convolutional neural network is proposed to perform image based denoising. Interference mitigation is phrased as a denoising task directly on the range-Doppler spectrum. The neural networks shows significant improvement with respect to signal-to-noise-plus-interference ratio in comparison to other state-of-the-art mitigation techniques, while better preserving phase information of the spectrum compared to other techniques.

AB  - The disconnector operation in the high-voltage substations forms a very fast transient overvoltage (VFTO), which leads to a sudden rise in local grounding potential. Due to double grounding of the secondary cable, the current transformer signal is interfered by the grounding grid potential difference. To study the mechanism of the interference signal, a simulation model based on the electro-magnetic transient program is built and the coupling path of the grounding grid potential difference is analyzed. According to the characteristics of interference signal, an adaptive algorithm is put forward and it mainly consists of three parts, including starting element, decision algorithm, and filtering algorithm. By selecting the appropriate parameters of wavelet transform, the filtering algorithm can discompose and reconstruct signal to remove the interference signal. The simulation results demonstrate that the filtering algorithm can effectively eliminate the interference signal caused by the grounding grid potential difference, with a 91% reduction of the root mean square error and a 135% improvement of the signal-to-noise ratio. Moreover, the accuracy of the measured data is ensured and the reliability of the relay protection is improved.

AB  - In this article, a distributed optical fiber sensing system for large infrastructure temperature monitoring is proposed. To meet the requirements of monitoring networks in terms of measurement accuracy, spatial resolution, and real-time or quasireal-time performance, a quaternion wavelet transform (QWT) image denoising algorithm is proposed to address the original edge node data for the structural monitoring networks of large infrastructures. A distributed Brillouin optical time-domain analysis (BOTDA) sensing system with a 40-km sensing fiber is established. The raw Brillouin gain spectrum (BGS) image is decomposed into one magnitude image and three phase images by QWT. The phase images of the OWT are distributed randomly and disorderly with respect to the noise, while the magnitude image of the quaternion wavelet is greatly affected by the noise. The useful message energy of the magnitude image is concentrated on a small number of coefficients with large amplitude, while the noise mainly corresponds to the coefficients with smaller amplitude. Then, the Bayes shrink threshold method is introduced to filter out noise in the magnitude image. The results indicate that the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the frequency uncertainty have been improved significantly. The accuracy of the retrieved Brillouin frequency shift from denoised BGS images reaches 0.2 MHz, which corresponds to a temperature error of ±0.1 °C. Less than 4 s are required to process a BGS image with 50  $\times $  40 000 pixels by the QWT denoising technique. The uploaded data obtained from 40 M bytes of raw data are reduced to 0.08 M bytes for each measurement. We hope that with technological progress and algorithm optimization, the distributed optical fiber sensing system based on the QWT image denoising algorithm will have an important role in the real-time application of large-scale infrastructure structural health monitoring for the Internet of Things.

AB  - Internet of Things (IoT) is an extension and expansion of the physical world based on Internet and various emerging technologies. In this paper, we investigate the problem of efficient noisy data transmission in a resource-constrained IoT -based application, we focus on the data transmission between the resource-limited sensor and the well-resource control center. We propose an efficient noisy data transmission scheme based on denoising Autoencoder (DAE). In order to train the DAE architecture, a modified random noise introducing (RNI) method is presented. The proposed data transmission scheme is named as DTDA-RNI. Performance evaluation results show that the proposed DTDA-RNI scheme outperforms in terms of a higher reconstruction accuracy, a lower compression rate, and a faster reconstruction speed.

AB  - Recently, the advancements in the field of wireless technologies and micro-electro-mechanical systems lead to the development of potential applications in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). The visual sensors in WSN create a significant impact on computer vision based applications such as pattern recognition and image restoration. generate a massive quantity of multimedia data. Since transmission of images consumes more computational resources, various image compression techniques have been proposed. But, most of the existing image compression techniques are not applicable for sensor nodes due to its limitations on energy, bandwidth, memory, and processing capabilities. In this article, we introduce a highly reliable and low-complexity image compression scheme using neighborhood correlation sequence (NCS) algorithm. The NCS algorithm performs the bit reduction operation and then encoded by a codec (such as PPM, Deflate, and Lempel Ziv Markov chain algorithm.) to further compress the image. The proposed NCS algorithm increases the compression performance and decreases the energy utilization of the sensor nodes with high fidelity. Moreover, it achieved a minimum end to end delay of 1074.46 ms at the average bit rate of 4.40 bpp and peak signal to noise ratio of 48.06 on the applied test images. On comparing with state-of-art methods, the proposed method maintains a better tradeoff between compression efficiency and reconstructed image quality.

AB  - Accurate Burden Surface Profile (BSP) detection is important for the operation of Blast Furnace (BF). The signal-to-noise ratio of radar signals changes greatly during both the charging period of BF and the long maintenance period of the radar device, which increases the difficulty of radar BSP detection. The traditional radar BSP detection method based on signal energy relies on manually selected detection thresholds according to the noise intensity. Hence, the accuracy of the traditional radar BSP detection method is not reliable in the long term. To address this problem, we propose a novel learning-based Key Points estimation (KP-BSP) method to detect the key points of radar reconstructed BSP image, and a new Key Points-based Connected Region Noise Reduction (KP-CRNR) algorithm to remove the noise-affected regions. The prediction deviation at detected key points (at the positions of the mechanical probes) is then used to correct the radar detection results, leading to the improvement of radar detection accuracy. The experimental data were collected from Wuhan Iron Steel Company No.7 BF. The results show that the proposed methods can achieve an average RMSE of 0.0156m, which is improved by more than 50% compared with previous methods. The long-term reliability of the proposed method is also demonstrated in this dataset.

AB  - With the rapid development of eye tracking technology, eye movements have become more and more important in human-computer interaction. Generally, eye movements are classified into fixation, saccade, and smooth pursuit. Since the eye movements are natural and fast, contain important cues for human cognitive state and visual attention, the eye movement behaviors are difficult to detect and classify. In this paper, the novel eye-movement data filtering and eye-movement classification algorithm are proposed. The nonlinear wavelet threshold denoising method was used to smooth the eye-movement data and detect saccades in the presence of smooth pursuit movements, according to different eye-movement behaviors related to the different characteristics of wavelet detail coefficients. Experiments were conducted to compare the eye-movement signal analyzing algorithm based on wavelet with other algorithms. The results showed that the eye-movement data filtering algorithm based on wavelet performed better than the other eye-movement filters. Moreover, the classification algorithm based on wavelet can classify different eye-movement behaviors more accurately. Then, we used an eye tracking technology to record and analyze the user's eye movement during the test, so as to get the user's psychological and cognitive state.

AB  - Knowing the location of a transceiver may enable advanced radio resource management strategies in sensing and communication networks. However, there are many scenarios where users operate in a non-cooperative mode with no localization-dedicated signaling with the network. As a result, conventional timing-based or propagation-model-based localization methods cannot be applied. This paper studies a model-free source localization problem where sensors only measure received signal strengths from a wireless signal source. The only assumption made is that the received signal strength decays homogeneously in all directions from the source. A measure of two-dimensional symmetry is developed via monotonic curve fitting to exploit the hidden symmetry and unimodality of the propagation. Based on this, a non-parametric source localization algorithm is derived. It is demonstrated that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms weighted centroid localization algorithms, and, in the low noise regime, a more than 50% of error reduction is observed.

AB  - Principal component analysis (PCA) is a well-established approach commonly used for dimensionality reduction. However, its computational cost and memory requirements hamper the adoption of PCA in heavily resource-constrained embedded platforms. Streaming approaches have been proposed that may enable embedded implementations of the PCA. Among them, the history PCA (HPCA) algorithm stands out for its robustness to the variability in parameters and accuracy. This article presents a parallel and memory-efficient implementation of HPCA in a structural health monitoring (SHM) application based on a heterogeneous network with sensor nodes measuring three-axial accelerations and gateways collecting measurements from several nodes and sending them to the cloud storage and analytic facility. In the targeted application, standard PCA reaches 15x compression factor with an average reconstruction signal-to-noise ratio of 16 dB and a negligible impact on the accuracy in the tracking of structural modal frequencies. By embedding HPCA on our SHM network gateways, we achieve the same compression factor as standard PCA, with more than 1000x reduction in data memory footprint for running the algorithm. Furthermore, we parallelize HPCA on the gateway, and we achieve a speedup of 7.1x (on 8 cores). Finally, we explore a fixed-point HPCA implementation on sensors (network end nodes), that maximally distributes compression workload, minimizes required communication bandwidth, and maintains the same quality of reconstruction as HPCA in floating point, with a compression factor of 10x.

AB  - Compressed Sensing has allowed a significant reduction of acquisition times in MRI, especially in the high resolution (e.g., 400 μm) context. However, in this setting CS must be combined with parallel reception as multichannel coil acquisitions maintain high input signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). To get rid of usual parallel imaging limitations (output SNR loss), non-Cartesian trajectories provide a gain in sampling efficiency in the CS context. In this paper, we propose a self-calibrating MRI reconstruction framework that handles variable density sampling. Low resolution sensitivity maps are estimated from the low frequency k-space content using an original and fast method while MR images are reconstructed using a nonlinear iterative algorithm, which promotes sparsity in the wavelet domain. As regards the optimization task, we compare three first-order proximal gradient methods: Forward Backward (FB), Fast Iterative Soft Thresolding Algorithm (FISTA) and Proximal Optimized Gradient Method (POGM) and evaluate their respective convergence speed. Comparison with state-of-the-art (i.e., ℓl-ESPIRiT) suggests that our self-calibrating POGM-based algorithm outperforms current approaches both in terms of image quality and computing time on several acquired data collected at 7 Tesla and we will focus more specifically on prospective non-Cartesian 8-fold accelerated in vivo Human brain data.

AB  - In this paper, we propose a novel speech enhancement paradigm which can effectively solve the problem of retrieving a desired speech signal in a multi-talker environment. The proposed speech enhancement paradigm involves a three-step procedure consisting of separation, ranking, and enhancement. First, a speech separation system – which could be a conventional spatial filter bank or more advanced separation systems – separates mixtures of speech signals captured by microphones into speech signals from candidate speakers. Next, novel ranking algorithms – proposed in this paper – are applied to determine the talker-of-interest amongst the separated speech signals. Finally, the speech signal of the talker-of-interest is estimated as a linear combination of the separated signals, whose weights are determined by the ranking algorithms. We propose ranking algorithms, which exploit turn-taking patterns between conversational partners in order to determine the talker-of-interest amongst competing speakers. Unlike some existing solutions, our ranking algorithms do not require access to additional sensors, e.g., EEG electrodes, cameras, etc., but only rely on microphone signals. Specifically, the proposed algorithms rank the separated speech signals based on the probability of speech overlaps and gaps with the user’s own voice. The speech signal with highest ranking is the talker with minimum probability of speech overlap and gap with the user’s own voice. The proposed ranking algorithms are shown highly effective at determining the talker-of-interest, since conversational partners, i.e., the user and the talker-of-interest, behaviorally avoid speech overlaps and gaps. We evaluate the proposed speech enhancement paradigm in two practical hearing aid related applications, where the objective is to enhance a speech signal of a conversational partner in a multi-talker environment. The results of the evaluation demonstrate that the proposed speech enhancement systems in both applications significantly outperform conventional speech enhancement systems.

AB  - Ultrasonic guided wave testing technology is currently widely used in industrial nondestructive testing (NDT), including defect detection in the floors of large tanks and oil pipelines. However, in addition to noise, practical scenarios of signal detection also present mode aliasing problems, which make it difficult to accurately identify and locate defects. In this paper, we propose an improved shear horizontal guided wave mode identification method using a variational mode decomposition (VMD) algorithm and a time-of-flight (TOF) extraction method using the synchrosqueezed wavelet transform (SSWT) algorithm. Moreover, we use the wavelet denoising method to denoise the original signal before applying VMD. The results show that the TOF errors obtained by the VMD method are all less than 5% and that the wavelet denoising of the original guided wave data can further reduce the errors (to less than 2%). In addition, the SSWT can modify the time-frequency analysis results of intrinsic mode functions obtained by the VMD method and provides accurate TOF data for different modes. Therefore, the proposed ultrasonic guided wave signal method is helpful for improving the defect detection sensitivity and accuracy of SH waves.

AB  - The rich spectral information provided by hyperspectral imaging has made this technology very useful in the classification of remotely sensed data. However, classification of hyperspectral data is typically affected by noise and the Hughes phenomenon due to the presence of hundreds of spectral bands and correlation among them, with usually a limited number of samples for training. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is a well-known technique that has been widely used for supervised dimensionality reduction of hyperspectral data. However, the use of LDA in hyperspectral remote sensing is limited due to its poor performance on small training datasets and the limited number of features that can be selected i.e., $c - 1$, where $c$ is the number of classes in the data. To solve these problems, this article presents a folded LDA (F-LDA) for dimensionality reduction of remotely sensed HSI data in small sample size scenarios. The proposed approach allows many more discriminant features to be selected in comparison to the conventional LDA since the selection is no longer bound by the limiting factor, leading to significantly higher accuracy in the classification of pixels under SSS restrictions. The proposed approach is evaluated on five different datasets, where the experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the F-LDA to the conventional LDA in terms of not only higher classification accuracy but also reduced computational complexity, and reduced contiguous memory requirements.

AB  - This work introduces new binaural beamforming algorithms for hearing aids, with a good robustness to errors in the estimated target source propagation model. Two different binaural beamforming designs are proposed. One design is based on an adaptive null positioning scheme, and the second is based on a combination of the adaptive null positioning scheme and wider beampatterns. Simulations are performed using signals and propagation models obtained from multichannel binaural hearing aids recordings, including some in a mildly reverberant environment. Evaluations are done in terms of noise reduction and target distortion. Evaluation results illustrate the robustness of the two proposed designs to errors between the true and estimated directions of arrival for the target source, and to mismatch between the anechoic propagation models used for the beamformers designs and the reverberant propagation models used to generate the signals at the sensors or beamformer inputs. Both designs surpass the performance of standard binaural Minimum Variance Distortionless Response (MVDR) and binaural Generalized-Side Lobe Canceler (GSC) beamformers.

AB  - Most of the reconstruction-based robust adaptive beamforming (RAB) algorithms require the covariance matrix reconstruction (CMR) by high-complexity integral computation. A Gauss-Legendre quadrature (GLQ) method with the highest algebraic precision in the interpolation-type quadrature is proposed to reduce the complexity. The interference angular sector in RAB is regarded as the GLQ integral range, and the zeros of the three-order Legendre orthogonal polynomial is selected as the GLQ nodes. Consequently, the CMR can be efficiently obtained by simple summation with respect to the three GLQ nodes without integral. The new method has significantly reduced the complexity as compared to most state-of-the-art reconstruction-based RAB techniques, and it is able to provide the similar performance close to the optimal. These advantages are verified by numerical simulations.

AB  - We report a real-time high-speed fiber Bragg grating (FBG) interrogator based on a fiber-optic interferometer. The signal processing is performed by using a low-cost field-programmable gate array (FPGA) system, which is programed to implement a phase-generated carrier (PGC) demodulation algorithm with multitone mixing (MTM) to provide distortion-free signals with high tolerance to modulation depth variations and light intensity fluctuations. The system can stream data at rates up to 1 MS/s and allows multiplexed processing up to two channels. Experimental results show simultaneous measurements of two FBGs, one of which was actuated at frequencies up to 100 kHz. The system features a 3-dB bandwidth of 280 kHz, and a dynamic wavelength resolution of 4.7 fm/Hz $^{\mathrm {1/2}}$ . We also demonstrate a strong reduction of distortion using the MTM approach with respect to the standard technique. Finally, we study the origin of the noise, demonstrating a reduction in common noise sources by using one of the FBGs as a reference. The system can measure FBGs centered at any position within the spectral band of the source, is polarization-independent, and is easily scalable to more than two measurement channels from the same interferometer.

AB  - This paper presents effects of inverter non-linearity, current sampling deviation and high frequency injected signal on vibration for a marine permanent magnet propulsion synchronous motor (PMSM) without position sensor. By using an embedded notch filter, major characteristic harmonic contained in position estimated and motor vibration are attenuated, and high frequency noise signal is suppressed at the same time. A random algorithm based on a two-state Markov chain is presented to realize randomization of injected frequency. The random algorithm is effective in homogenizing current spectrum and reducing motor vibration peak value caused by high frequency signal injected. Finally, the correctness of theoretical analysis and effectiveness of the proposed strategy are verified by simulation.

AB  - Many multi-microphone speech enhancement algorithms require the relative transfer function (RTF) vector of the desired speech source, relating the acoustic transfer functions of all array microphones to a reference microphone. In this paper, we propose a computationally efficient method to estimate the RTF vector in a diffuse noise field, which requires an additional microphone that is spatially separated from the microphone array, such that the spatial coherence between the noise components in the microphone array signals and the additional microphone signal is low. Assuming this spatial coherence to be zero, we show that an unbiased estimate of the RTF vector can be obtained. Based on real-world recordings experimental results show that the proposed RTF estimator outperforms state-of-the-art estimators using only the microphone array signals in terms of estimation accuracy and noise reduction performance.

AB  - Limited by the micro-electromechanical system (MEMS) fabrication technology, the in-operation drift of MEMS gyroscope which degrades measurement repeatability, accuracy, and stability has non-stationary wide-band components and a large difference between each power cycle. The drift limits the usability of MEMS gyroscope in a variety of field applications where autonomous and repeatable operation is required over a long time in harsh environmental conditions. Therefore, a novel method is proposed to compensate the drift. At first, an improved complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition is used to decompose the original signals into a series of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs), and the threshold de-noising method is adopted to filter the IMFs; then, the de-noised sub-series are reconstructed into training and testing dataset, respectively, and the bagging extreme learning machine-based model has been trained; finally, the compensation signal is predicted by the model with testing dataset, and the desired results can be obtained after compensation. The proposed method has been validated by a 9000-s in-operation experiment of CRG20 by comparing it with a typical method. The experiment demonstrated that the proposed method can enhance generalization performance and can boost compensation accuracy of the model, and the bias instability reduced from 0.0785°/s to 0.0046°/s.

AB  - In the last few years, forensic researchers have developed a wide set of techniques to blindly attribute an image to the device used to shoot it. Among these techniques, those based on photo response non uniformity (PRNU) have shown incredibly accurate results, thus they are often considered as a reference baseline solution. The rationale behind these techniques is that each camera sensor leaves on acquired images a characteristic noise pattern. This pattern can be estimated and uniquely mapped to a specific acquisition device through a cross-correlation test. In this paper, we study the possibility of leveraging recent findings in the deep learning field to attack PRNU-based detectors. Specifically, we focus on the possibility of editing an image through convolutional neural networks in a visually imperceptible way, still hindering PRNU noise estimation. Results show that performing such an attack is possible, even though an informed forensic analyst can reduce its impact through a smart test.

The present work tackles the problem tackles the problem of frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) to FMCW interference. In this context, we propose a signal processing technique to blindly identify and remove interference by using the fast Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) algorithm to project the interference signals in a reduced chirplet basis, and separate it from the target signal with minimal loss of information. Significant reduction of the noise-plus-interference levels are observed in measured data acquired with state of the art automotive sensors.

AB  - A 16-channel closed-loop neuromodulation system-on-chip (SoC) for human epileptic seizure control is proposed and designed. In the proposed SoC, a 16-channel neural-signal acquisition unit (NSAU), a biosignal processor (BSP), a 16-channel high-voltage-tolerant stimulator (HVTS), and wireless power and bidirectional data telemetry are designed. In the NSAU, the input protection circuit is used to prevent MOSFET from overstressing by the high-voltage stimulations. Hence, NSAUs can share electrodes with stimulators. The auto-reset chopper-stabilized capacitive-coupled instrumentation amplifiers (AR-CSCCIAs) are designed with the chopper-stabilized technique with a new offset reduction loop. The measured input-referred noise is 2.09 μVrms and the noise-efficiency factor (NEF) is 3.78. The entropy-and-spectrum seizure detection algorithm is implemented in the BSP with 0.76-s seizure detection latency and 97.8% detection accuracy. When the seizure onset is detected by the BSP, the HVTS with adaptive supply control delivers 0.5-3-mA biphasic current stimulation to suppress the seizure onset. The proposed SoC is powered wirelessly, and the bidirectional data telemetry is realized through the same pair of coils in 13.56 MHz. The downlink data rate is 211 Kb/s with the binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) modulation and a new BPSK demodulator. The uplink data rate is 106 Kb/s with the load-shift keying (LSK) modulation. The proposed SoC is fabricated in a 0.18-μm CMOS technology and occupies 25 mm2. Electrical tests have been performed to characterize the SoC performance. In vivo animal experiments using mini-pigs have been performed to successfully verify the closed-loop neuromodulation functions on epileptic seizure suppression.

AB  - Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) is a method to measure cardiac activities without any contact sensors. Non-contact sensors include radar, laser, and digital cameras, and there have been wide developments regarding the measurement of rPPG signals using continuous face frames. However, non-contact sensors are quite sensitive to the subject's motion, which causes motion artifacts. In this paper, two hypotheses are proposed: a) the motion artifacts are caused by unevenly reflected light due to the curvature of the subject's face; and b) melanin and residuals in the continuous face frames are time-varying values whenever the subject's movement is triggered. Adaptive noise cancellation based on recursive least square (ANS based on RLS) using the Lambert-Beer law and the hue-saturation-intensity (HSI) model were applied. The former is used for skin modeling, and the latter is used to reduce noises derived by the curvature of the face. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm is directly applied to two-dimensional continuous face frames and results in the rPPG signal and rPPG image, respectively. To evaluate proposed algorithm, two different experiments (e.g., static and dynamic situation) were conducted. Furthermore, in a study with 15 participants, the performances of heart rate estimation and heart rate variability (HRV) were evaluated by comparing the proposed method with previously developed methods. The results showed that a) the artifacts derived by head movement are efficiently removed, compared to previous methods; and b) rPPG images describing the spread of facial blood flow are acquired in real-time.

AB  - Monitoring of health parameters during physical exercise is an important aspect of both sports and rehabilitation medicine. Photoplethysmography (PPG) is routinely employed for low-cost heart rate (HR) measurement; however, monitoring during physical exercise is made difficult by the presence of motion artifacts. In this paper, we present an approach that combines denoising by subspace decomposition and Fourier-based HR measurement, and finally, smoothing and tracking by a Kalman filter. Using publicly available real-life PPG traces, we demonstrate accuracy and performance by an extensive set of experimental results, comparing them with similar algorithms proposed in the literature.

AB  - This paper proposes a novel method for traffic flow detection using distributed optical fiber acoustic sensing (DAS). Different from the traditional traffic flow detection method, this method detects the traffic vibration signal using a fiber optic cable. Distributed fiber-optic acoustic sensing technology can provide fully distributed acoustic information along the entire fiber link, and thus external acoustic signals from an arbitrary point can be detected and located. This paper uses DAS to obtain traffic vibration data. Using the characteristics of traffic vibration data, this paper proposes an improved wavelet threshold algorithm and an improved dual-threshold algorithm and verifies the feasibility and effectiveness of these methods. Finally, the experimental results from a vehicle-counting test show that the counting error is smaller for a single vehicle passing through the detection area and that the counting error is larger if multiple vehicles pass through the detection area continuously. In vehicle speed estimation, the results show good accuracy, and the error range is controlled to less than 6%.

AB  - Radio interferometry usually compensates for high levels of noise in sensor/antenna electronics by throwing data and energy at the problem: observe longer, then store and process it all. We propose instead a method to remove the noise explicitly before imaging. To this end, we developed an algorithm that first decomposes the instances of antenna correlation matrix, the so-called visibility matrix, into additive components using Singular Spectrum Analysis and then cluster these components using graph Laplacian matrix. We show through simulation the potential for radio astronomy, in particular, illustrating the benefit for LOFAR, the low frequency array in Netherlands. Least-squares images are estimated with far higher accuracy with low computation cost without the need for long observation time.

AB  - Collaborative beamforming (CB) has recently emerged as a promising technique for transmission range extension and energy consumption reduction in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). However, due to the constrained energy and limited data processing capabilities of sensor nodes, the performance optimization of CB mainlobe and sidelobe control (SC) encounters challenges in the practical deployment. To address these challenges, we present an architecture of software-defined energy harvesting WSN (SD-EHWSN) for CB communications. Specifically, we first design the mechanism of CB communications based on the software-defined network (SDN) architecture to reduce the communication and computational overhead of sensor nodes. Then, we consider solar energy-harvesting system to achieve long-term operation of WSN and utilize a stationary Markov (SM) chain to model the arrival process of solar energy. Based on the stochastic nature of solar energy, a stochastic game model is developed to formulate the problem of CB optimization in SD-EHWSN, and the existence proof of Nash equilibria is provided. Based on the analytical results, we propose a reinforcement learning algorithm to maximize the long-term signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) performance with SC and prove the convergence of the algorithm. Simulation results are presented to validate the efficiency of the proposed scheme for CB communications in SD-EHWSN.

The trajectory equation of the projectile is given, and a quantitative perturbation algorithm for the launcher and the directional tube is proposed, which provides a theoretical basis for the calculation of the hit rate. Then the MEMS sensor error is processed by quaternion, Kalman filtering and wavelet threshold denoising methods to improve the precision of hit accuracy calculation.

AB  - Conventional transmit subarray partitioning schemes of phased-MIMO radar will cause several problems, the reduction of array aperture, the increase of feeding network complexity and optimization algorithms time cost. Focus on the problems above, this paper proposes a deep learning-based interleaved sparse transmit subarray partitioning method. Firstly, the training data is generated by phased-MIMO array manifold matrix. Secondly, a dimensionality reduction method for radar data is introduced to reduce the dimensionality of the sample data while minimizing information loss. Then, a lightweight convolutional neural network is constructed for training and the optimal array structures is selected by classification. Finally, linear and plane arrays experiment results show that our proposed method can achieve 97.95% classification accuracy, better than other conventional dimensionality reduction methods and neural networks; compared with the traditional SCP partitioning method, our proposed method has similar beampattern sidelobe level and DOA estimation accuracy, but the time cost is greatly reduced.

AB  - In order to prevent people from touching the floor buttons when riding in the elevator in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we propose a design method of elevator auxiliary control system based on speech recognition. The hardware design part of the system includes voice module, photoelectric sensor module and main control circuit module. On the basis of hardware design, the process from recognizing the voice commands of passengers in the elevator car to transmitting the recognition results to the elevator control main system is realized through programming. With the goal of improving the accuracy of speech recognition, the differential feature parameter algorithm based on the Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) is used. Then, our experiments show that least mean square (LMS) adaptive filtering is an effective method for the noise reduction of the voice signal when processing passengers' commands.

AB  - In applications based on radar sensors, target movement can be analyzed using micro-Doppler spectrogram, which is a time-frequency representation of micro-Doppler signature. However, the noise in spectrogram brings difficulties for applications. Conventional denoising algorithms are not specific to micro- Doppler data, they could only deal with a fixed level of noise and fail to effectively denoise under low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) circumstances. To overcome the drawbacks, we propose a method based on Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to remove the noise in micro-Doppler spectrograms. Our method is applicable to a wide range of noise intensity, for which can be called a blind denoiser. We verify the effectiveness of the proposed method on both simulated and measured data, experimental results compared with competing algorithms demonstrate the superiority of our method.

AB  - The Software-defined radio (SDR) technology is considered as a promising solution to address the issue of spectrum scarcity by providing a high level of flexibility and configurability to wireless communication systems. This technology, widely used in cognitive radio (CR) networks, aims at optimizing the spectrum efficiency. However, to reach this objective, a new conception of spectrum sensing methods needs to be adopted. Indeed, in the emerging wireless communications systems, telecom researchers face the challenge of detecting the presence of energy with a very low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in a very complex environment. For this purpose, for complex environments such as CR networks, machine-learning (ML) algorithms seem to be a suitable solution allowing a smart spectrum-sensing scheme. This scheme enables the increase of the signal detection probability and the decrease the false detection probability of signal detection. In this paper, four supervised ML models are compared: Naïve Bayes classifier, Support Vector Machine, Gradient Boosting Machine and Distributed Random Forest. Furthermore, a principal component analysis (PCA) is performed to reduce the dimensionality of the complex dataset while preserving the useful variability. Their performance is subsequently evaluated by computing their receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The entire algorithms are then implemented and demonstrated using the GNU (GNU’s Not Unix) Radio platform and an SDR-based electronic card, HackRF One.

AB  - The fast-growing networked computing devices create many distributed systems and generate new signals on a large scale. Typical applications include peer-to-peer streaming of multimedia data, crowd- sourcing, and measurement by sensor networks. Therefore, the massive amount of networked data is a form of big data, calling for new data structures and algorithms different from classical ones suitable for small data sizes. We consider a vital data format for recording information from networked distributed systems: signals on graphs. A significant concern is to protect the privacy of large scales of signals when processed at third parties, such as cloud data centers. A de-facto solution is to outsource encrypted data before they arrive at the third-parties. We propose a novel and efficient privacy-protected outsourced denoising algorithm based on the information-theoretic secure multi-party computation (secure MPC). Among the operations of signals on graphs, denoising is useful before further meaningful processing can occur. We experiment with our algorithms in a popular platform of secure MPC and compare it with Paillier's homomorphic encryption approach. The results demonstrate a better efficiency of our approach.

AB  - The localization of short events arising within a network subsequently leading to wave propagation into it, is of interest in many applications. This work extend (Caputo et al., 2019) which demonstrated the identifiability of a source from two detectors in a $N$ nodes graph. We show that, rather than a source, a boundary condition identification is also possible and demonstrate a generalyzed unicity result. Furthermore, we extend the identification algorithm proposed in (Caputo et al., 2019) to an arbitrary number of sensors, and estimate its complexity which depends on sensors number $N_{s}$ and time dicretisation $N_{t}$. Increasing detectors number increases source identification robustness to noise up to a cut-off number being a small raction of $N$. This cutt-off detector density for efficiency in noise reduction is of practical significance. We also analyze and discuss the method sensitivity to total recording time $T_{e}$, sampling frequency, and signal to noise ratio. Finally we propose a pre-sectorisation to improve the systematic exploration algorithm proposed in (Caputo et al., 2019) and we show a $O(N)$ drop in complexity leading to a $O(N^{3})$ cost for the source identification. Several tests of the method on model and real graphs confirm and support the presented results.

AB  - Independent Component Analysis (ICA) has emerged as a useful method for separation of components, such as in removing noise from data. We examine one of the challenges of ICA - instability, particularly in high dimensions, when the independent components vary, each time when ICA is performed. This may be due to various causes including the stochastic nature of the algorithm and the additive noise. The objective of this study is to examine denoising and stability issues of ICA in high dimensions and make a comparative evaluation of select approaches. We take a challenging electrocardiogram dataset which is a high-dimensional time series of multiple sensors. We experiment with a mix of approaches and methods - for resampling, clustering, ICA algorithms and dimensionality. We check the internal validity using the Icasso stability index, the Amari separation performance index and the Minimum Distance (MD) index. The first key contribution of this work is that it finds counter-evidence to the claim that resampling (bootstrapping) tackles the question of stability. The second contribution is that it finds evidence of an important limitation of the Minimum Distance index when dealing with high dimensional data - the index may become highly concentrated and may remain sub-optimal at all dimensions. Selectively removing noise components by visual inspection can improve the Amari, the Icasso or the MD index values. Some automated tools exist, but in high dimensions, visual inspection of the individual components is still required for effective denoising - data driven methods are not good enough.

AB  - For new military aircraft a specification of sensor characteristics and performance is required at an early stage in the design cycle, well before testing of a prototype. In the early days of military aviation the Johnson criteria [1] were used to determine the sensor resolution required for target recognition by a human. In the present day sensor data are processed by computer using various Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) algorithms. However there is no accepted method for predicting the sensor resolution and SNR required for reliable ATR and hence there is risk that any chosen sensor may fail to support the required ATR performance. This paper reports a study into the use of publicly-available CAD models for aircraft to address this requirement. The study considers the worst-case confusion between two views of 15 different aircraft types. For simplicity only rotations by an angle θ about the Z (vertical) axis are considered. Firstly the sensor resolution and noise level is fixed. Then for each aircraft type and view angle an ensemble of synthetic silhouettes are generated. Using these ensembles, a-posteriori distributions of 5 standard scale-invariant shape features (eccentricity, orientation, solidity, circularity and bounding box aspect ratio) are estimated for each view angle θ. The performance of ATR at the given resolution and noise level is predicted by estimating the Bayes Error Rate [2] when deciding between each aircraft type and the 14 non-matching types using these features. The worst-case confusion in terms of erroneous aircraft type and view angle is identified. The sensor resolution is then changed and the above process repeated to investigate the effect of varying sensor resolution on performance. As expected, high sensor resolution leads to low probability of misclassification, even in the worst-case. Reduction in resolution and increasing noise level causes the Bayes Error Rate to rise quickly. The Bayes Error Rate gives a fundamental limit to the reliability of classification, irrespective of the actual type of classification algorithm used. The predictions from the model are confirmed by testing against a standard classifier for specific discrimination examples. Further development of the approach presented is expected to yield a method for specifying sensor resolution requirements for specific ATR problems.

AB  - The ability to track people's movement (e.g., the human walking) is an important topic of interest in numerous research areas. State-of-the-art systems based on, e.g., dead reckoning, usually do not need any additional infrastructure. The disadvantage of the method is the poor accuracy because of measurement noises. The typical approach to noise cancellation is zero-velocity update (ZUPT). The method takes advantages of the cyclical nature of human walking. Thus some limitations of the ZUPT approach we propose the novel method based on transient artifact reduction algorithm (TARA) to mitigate these errors by noise estimation. TARA is the novel approach to estimate the low-frequency components in the signals by applying the concept of sparse optimization. The proposed algorithm was validated on synthetic and real signals. The tests for synthetic signals were performed for pulse signals with noise characterized by the Hurst exponent. In real signals studies, we applied the signals from three different data sets that were prepared to test the algorithm to human walking estimation. We found that TARA can estimate the underlying noise in the dead-reckoning-based systems. The results show that the TARA method can be used to improve the accuracy of human walking speed estimation as an alternative to the state-of-the-art method such as ZUPT. The results prove to be the important step toward unaided estimation of human walking velocity based on dead-reckoning technique.

AB  - We present a novel approach to locate microseismic sources in situ and in real time in distributed sensor networks (DSN). We propose a distributed reverse time migration (RTM) microseismic source location algorithm. RTM-based methods have advantages in passive source location in terms of robustness and accuracy. However, the traditional methods have a centralized data collection and ex situ postprocessing style, and were not designed for in situ and real-time seismic imaging, so communication and computation costs were not considered. Utilizing newly emerging DSN, real-time and in situ microseismic source location becomes possible. Thus, we specially design a joint imaging condition for the DSN system to reduce both computation and communication burdens. The tradeoff, however, is location resolution reduction. Sequentially, we employ a waveform inversion approach to obtain a finer resolution microseismic source location result. Finally, we validate the proposed method using both synthetic and field seismic records. Our approach shows promising performances using synthetics with single and multiple sources, as well as with field data. The proposed waveform inversion-assisted distributed RTM location algorithm obtains high-resolution source location results and significantly reduced communication and computation costs, even at a low signal-to-noise ratio.

AB  - Our capacity to transmit data off of a spacecraft to the ground station has not kept pace with rate of data generation from advanced sensors. One solution is to reduce the size of the data prior to transmission through advanced compression techniques. In this paper, software and hardware implementations of a novel data compression algorithm were used to compress overhead persistent infrared data with synthetic embedded dim targets. An image processing technique was subsequently applied to the decompressed data to recover the embedded targets within the image stack, and the signal-to-noise ratio of the detected targets were examined as a function of compression ratio. This paper examines the detection signal-to-noise ratio and relative speed-up for compression of 1200 frames of infrared data implemented in a general-purpose processor and a field-programmable gate array. The advantages of the FPGA implementation for processing efficiency were clearly shown, however, the reduced data precision had a negative impact on our ability to recover the dim target from the post compressed data.

AB  - HDR images have traditionally been obtained by merging multiple exposures each captured with a different exposure time. However, this approach entails longer capture times and necessitates deghosting if the captured scene contains moving objects. With the advent of modern camera sensors that can perform per-pixel exposure modulation, it is now possible to capture all of the required exposures within a single shot. The new challenge then becomes how to best combine different pixels with different exposure values into a single full-resolution and low-noise HDR image. We propose a joint multi-exposure frame deinterlacing and denoising algorithm powered by deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN). In our algorithm, we first train two DCNNs, with one tuned for reconstructing low exposures and the other for high exposures. Each DCNN takes the same mosaicked dual-ISO input image and outputs either the low exposure or high exposure depending on the type of the network. The resulting exposures can be demosaicked and converted to the desired target color space prior to HDR assembly. Our evaluations indicate that the quality of our results significantly surpasses the state-of-the-art in single-image HDR reconstruction algorithms.

AB  - Hyperspectral imaging technology has been popularly applied in remote sensing because it collects echoed signals from across the electromagnetic (EM) spectrum and thereby contributes fruitfully spatial-spectral information. However, the processing or storage of high-data-volume hyperspectral images (HSIs), also viewed as snapshots varying with the EM spectrum, burdens the hardware resources, especially for the high spectral resolution and spatial resolution cases. To address this challenge, a novel unsupervised dimensionality reduction method based on the dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) algorithm is proposed to analyze hyperspectral data. This method decomposes the spatial-spectral HSIs in terms of spatial dynamic modes and corresponding spectral patterns. Then, these spatial-spectral patterns are combined to reconstruct the raw HSIs via a low-rank model. Furthermore, we extend the proposed DMD method to hyperspectral data in the tensor form and title it CubeDMD to actualize the compression of HSIs in horizontal, vertical, and spectral dimensions. Our proposed data-driven scheme is benchmarked by the real hyperspectral data measured at the Salinas scenes and Pavia University. It is demonstrated that the HSIs can be reconstructed accurately and effectively by the proposed low-rank model. The mean peak signal-to-noise ratio between the reconstructed and original HSIs can reach 31.47 dB, and the corresponding mean spectral angle mapper is only 0.1037. Our work provides a useful tool for the analysis of HSIs with a low-rank representation.

AB  - For fiber-optic sensing signal recognition systems, signal feature extraction is the key to determining the accuracy of signal recognition and classification. Mel frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) can be used for feature extraction of optical fiber signals. In order to further improve the accuracy of fiber vibration signal pattern recognition, this paper proposes a feature extraction algorithm based on Compensation Distance Estimation Technology (CDET). The algorithm first extracts the MFCC feature vector from the optical fiber vibration signal, uses the compensation distance estimation technology to evaluate the feature through the feature screening strategy, and optimizes the feature by deleting the redundant vector. In order to verify the effectiveness of the algorithm, the traditional MFCC algorithm and the PCA algorithm dimensionality reduction and the proposed algorithm are used to compare the classification experiments. The experimental results show that the feature extraction method based on CDET can further improve the accuracy of the classification results by 5%. After adding different signal-to-noise ratio noises, classification experiments are performed to verify that the proposed algorithm has certain anti-noise performance.

AB  - MEMS sensors have been used in many applications including navigation systems. However, these sensors suffer from highly noisy measurements. If left untreated, these errors will significantly degrade the ultimate navigational solution. Hence, applying a pre-filtering technique becomes a necessity to de-noise these sensor signals to improve the overall system performance. While wavelet denoising is the most common technique for sensor data pre-filtering, it may not be suitable for real-time implementations. This paper explores another method; namely, Savitzky-Golay filters, which can provide competitive denoising performance with a less computationally demanding algorithm. The purpose of the paper is to examine the performance of the new method against wavelet de-noising with respect to both positioning and attitude accuracy and computations time. We applied the filter to denoise MEMS-based inertial sensors data in a tightly coupled integrated INS/GPS system. Our results showed that the new method outperformed the wavelet denoising approach. Moreover, the new method demands much less computations time, which makes it more suitable for embedded systems and real-time applications.

AB  - This paper proposes a novel fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) technique for grid-tied PV systems. The proposed approach deals with system uncertainties (current/voltage variability, noise, measurement errors, ⋯) by using an interval-valued data representation, and with large-scale systems by using a dataset size-reduction framework. The failures encompassed in this study are the open-circuit/short-circuit, islanding, output current sensor, and partial shading faults. In the proposed FDD approach, named interval reduced kernel PCA (IRKPCA)-based Random Forest (IRKPCA-RF), the feature extraction and selection phase is performed using the IRKPCA models while the fault classification is ensured using the RF algorithm. The main contribution of the proposed approach is to provide a good trade-off between low computation time and high classification metrics. The performance of the proposed IRKPCA-RF approach is assessed using a set of emulated data of a grid-tied PV system operating under healthy and faulty conditions. The presented results show that the proposed IRKPCA-RF approach is characterized by enhanced diagnosis metrics, classification rate, and computation time compared to the classical techniques.

AB  - This paper presents a cumulant-based algorithm for near-field noncircular sources localization with a symmetric uniform linear array. It first constructs three extended matrices. Then, based on the rotational invariance property in extended cumulant-domain signal subspace, coarse direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimates are obtained. With the course results used as reference, the algorithm is able to disambiguate the cyclic phase ambiguities when the equivalent sub-array spacing exceeds a half wavelength. Thus, higher precision DOA estimates can be obtained. Finally, with the estimated DOAs, only one-dimensional searching is needed to obtain the range estimates via rank-reduction algorithm. The proposed algorithm avoids two-dimensional searching and parameters pairing. In addition, compared with the existing near-field noncircular sources localization algorithm, the significant characteristic of the proposed algorithm is that it exploits cumulant and the noncircularity of signal to achieve extended steering vector. Cumulant is insensitive to Gaussian (white or color) noise. Consequently, the proposed one provides DOA estimates with improved precision especially at low signal-to-noise ratios. Furthermore, it doubles the number of detectable sources. Total least square ESPRIT algorithm is exploited to yield search free estimates of near-field bearing parameters. Computer simulations are carried out to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm.

AB  - Human breath analysis plays important role for diagnosis and management of pulmonary diseases to guarantee normal health. The critical task is to distinguish normal and abnormal lung sounds. This research work presents a scheme for breath analysis used to detect irregular patterns occurred in respiratory cycles due to respiratory diseases. After de-noising breath segments using wavelet de-noising method, intrinsic mode functions are extracted with complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition (CEEMD). Instantaneous frequency (IF) and instantaneous envelope are extracted to get robust features for classification. The study contains breath samples captured using smartphone under natural setting. The data set contains 255 breath cycles. For cycle classification, Bag-of-word was applied to group segments based features. The support vector machine (SVM) was applied on randomly partitioned data samples. Experiments resulted with performance accuracy of (75.21%±2) for asthmatic inspiratory cycles and (75.5%±3%) for complete Respiratory Sounds (RS) cycle with diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) of 20.61% and 13.S7% respectively.

AB  - Deep learning methods have shown early progress in analyzing complicated ECG signals, especially in heartbeat classification and arrhythmia detection. However, there is still a long way to go in terms of health-related data analysis. This research provides a duel structured and bidirectional Recurrent Neural Network(RNN) method for arrhythmia classification that addresses the issues with multilayered dilated convolution neural network (CNN) models. Initially, the data is preprocessed by Chebyshev Type II filtering that is faster and do not use statistical characteristics. Noise from the preprocesed filter is aslo removed by using Daubechies wavelet that can able to solve fractal problems and signal discontinuities. An then Z-normalization is done using Pan-Tompkins normalization technique for handling of different normally distributed samples. Finally, a generative adversarial network (GAN)-based synthetic signal is generated for recreation of signal to handle imbalanced signal class. The proposed Bidirectional RNN with Dilated CNN (BRDC) appears to take advantage of the potentiality of multilayered dilated CNN and bidirectional RNN unit (bidirectional gated recurrent Units, BiGRU - bidirectional long short-term memory, BiLSTM) architecture to generate fusion features. Finally, the signals are classified by fully connected layer and Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function. The PhysioNet 2017 challenge dataset is used to train and validate the proposed model. By combining fusion features with dilated CNN, the learned model significantly improves the classification performance and interpretability. The experimental findings show that, for MIT-BIH provided ECG (electrocardiogram) data to identify arrhythmia, the proposed BRDC model outperforms existing models with 99.90 % accuracy, 98.41 % F1, 97.96 % precision, and 99.90 % recall during training. One of the significant findings of this study is that the proposed approach can significantly reduce time length when employing RNN networks with multilayered dilated CNN. Overall, our hybrid model using BiGRU-BiLSTM and multi-layered dilated CNN provides a cost-effective ECG signal reduction and high-performance automated recognition technique to identify arrhythmia. Our future improvement will focus on the classification of numerous arrhythmia signal-based data, automatic and cloud based ECG classification.

AB  - One basic operation of Internet-of-Things (IoT) networks is to acquire a function of distributed data collected from sensors over wireless channels, called wireless data aggregation (WDA). In the presence of dense sensors, low-latency WDA poses a design challenge for high-mobility or mission critical IoT applications. A promising solution is a low-latency multi-access scheme, called over-the-air computing (AirComp), that supports simultaneous transmission such that an access point (AP) can estimate and receive a summation-form function of the distributed sensing data by exploiting the waveform-superposition property of a multi-access channel. In this work, we propose a multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) AirComp framework for an IoT network with clustered multi-antenna sensors and an AP with large receive arrays. The framework supports low-complexity and low-latency AirComp of a vector-valued function. The contributions of this work are two-fold. Define the AirComp error as the error in the functional value received at AP due to channel noise. First, under the criterion of minimum error, the optimal receive beamformer at the AP, called decomposed aggregation beamformer (DAB), is shown to have a decomposed architecture: the inner component focuses on channel-dimension reduction and the outer component focuses on joint equalization of the resultant low-dimensional small-scale fading channels. In addition, an algorithm is designed to adjust the ranks of individual components of the DAB for a further performance improvement. Second, to provision DAB with the required channel state information (CSI), a low-latency channel feedback scheme is proposed by intelligently leveraging the AirComp principle to support simultaneous channel feedback by sensors. The proposed framework is shown by simulation to substantially reduce AirComp error compared with the existing design without considering channel structures.

AB  - Multispectral filter arrays (MSFA) is increasingly used in multispectral imaging. While many previous works studied the denoising algorithms for CFA based cameras, denoising MSFA raw images is little discussed. The major challenges for denoising MSFA data include 1) more channels than CFA and no predominant channel; 2) compatibility between denoising and the subsequent demosaicking process. To overcome these challenges, we propose a new deep residual network designed to account for the uniqueness of MSFA mosaic patterns. First, a split and stride convolution layer is innovated to match the mosaic pattern of the MSFA raw image. Then, data augmentation using MSFA shifting and dynamic noise is proposed to make the model robust to different noise levels. In addition, a new network optimization criteria is also suggested by using the noise standard deviation to normalize the L1 loss function. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed deep residual network outperforms the state-of-the-art denoising algorithms in MSFA field.

AB  - In this paper, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a scheme of deep learning enhanced long-range fast Brillouin optical time-domain analysis (BOTDA). The volumetric data from fast BOTDA is denoised and demodulated by using a deep video denoising network and a deep neural network, respectively. Benefitting from the advanced deep learning algorithms, the sensing range of fast BOTDA is extended to 10 km successfully. In experiment, vibration signal is measured with a sampling rate of 23 Hz, 2 m spatial resolution, and 1.19 MHz accuracy over 10 km single-mode fiber with only 4 averages. Due to the low computational complexity and GPU acceleration, the network takes less than 0.04 s to process 100 × 21800 data, which is much faster than the conventional algorithms. This method provides the potential for real-time vibration measurement in fast BOTDA with long sensing range.

AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is a very high and accurate technology for remote sensing. SAR images are very exploited for change detection and monitoring because of their high resolution. Because of the coherent retro diffusion of the backscattered radar waves with the rigorous earth surface, SAR images are characterized by a multiplicative noise called speckle that influences their analysis. For this reason, several methods and algorithms have been introduced for speckle noise reduction from these images. This paper proposes and exploits a convolution neural network (CNN) based technique for SAR image denoising. The performance of the introduced technique is studied firstly by using numerical simulation where we added speckle noise with a different variance; then, a quantitative appraisal is presented by using three metrics: Peak to signal noise ratio (PSNR), Edge preservation index (EPI) and image quality index (Q). Finally, we apply the proposed method on a real SAR image obtained by the Sentinel-l satellite and ERSSAR sensor.

AB  - Detection of breast cancer in its early stage is critical for reducing the death rate. In this paper, a compact and flexible breast tumor sensing system is designed using dual-polarized UWB antenna arrays. Each UWB unit is composed of two orthogonally placed circular monopoles, which are printed on flexible and low-profile Kapton polyimide. The antennas are fed by single-side coplanar waveguides for size reduction. A wide band from 3.9 GHz to 19 GHz is obtained, with an isolation of above 16 dB over the operating band. High fidelity factors are achieved at different solid angles, indicating little distortion of the signal and stable sensing ability. To obtain the image of the tumor, eight UWB units are employed surrounding the breast phantom. Using the reflected and scattered signals from the antennas, 3D images of the breast are reconstructed using delay-and-sum (DAS) algorithm. Attributed to the dual-polarized UWB antennas, accurate location and size of the tumors are retained with little clutter. Moreover, the proposed system can detect two tumors with an edge to edge distance of 15 mm. Experiments have been carried out on rotating platforms, with the tumor successfully detected in the measurement. The proposed tumor sensing system is suitable for wearable applications due to its compact size and flexibility.

AB  - Using Kinect sensors to monitor and provide feedback to patients performing intervention or rehabilitation exercises is an upcoming trend in healthcare. However, the joint positions measured by the Kinect sensor are often unreliable, especially for joints that are occluded by other parts of the body. Also, users' motion sequences differ significantly even when doing the same exercise and are not temporally aligned, making the evaluation of the correctness of their movement challenging. This paper aims to develop a Kinect-based intervention system, which can guide the users to perform the exercises more effectively. To circumvent the unreliability of the Kinect measurements, we developed a denoising algorithm using a Gaussian Process regression model. We simultaneously capture the joint positions using both a Kinect sensor and a motion capture (MOCAP) system during a training stage and train a Gaussian process regression model to map the noisy Kinect measurements to the more accurate MOCAP measurements. For the sequences alignment issue, we develop a gradient-weighted dynamic time warping approach that can automatically recognize the endpoints of different subsequences from the original user's motion sequence, and furthermore temporally align the subsequences from multiple actors. During a live exercise session, the system applies the same alignment algorithm to a live-captured Kinect sequence to divide it into subsequences, and furthermore compare each subsequence with its corresponding reference subsequence, and generates feedback to the user based on the comparison results. Our results show that the denoised Kinect measurements by the proposed denoising algorithm are more accurate than several benchmark methods and the proposed temporal alignment approach can precisely detect the end of each subsequence in an exercise with very small amount of delay. These methods have been integrated into a prototype system for guiding patients with risks for breast-cancer related lymphedema to perform a set of lymphatic exercises. The system can provide relevant feedback to the patient performing an exercise in real time.

AB  - The Internet of Underwater Things (IoUT) gradually becomes the future direction of ocean. Many devices, which are called the sources, are deployed in the sea to fulfill scientific, civilian, and military needs. If the locations of these sources are leaked, it will cause a serious economic and military crisis. Thus, in this context, the source location privacy protection becomes critical. In this paper, we focus on the source location privacy protection of underwater acoustic sensor networks (UASNs), where a multi-channel interference based source location privacy protection scheme (MCISLP) is proposed. The MCISLP mainly contains four steps. First, to enhance the sense of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) for nodes, a noise reduction method is proposed. Then, based on the previous step, an AUV movement prediction method for nodes is presented to ensure the success of packet transmission. After that, for the information exchange among nodes, given the interference of multiple underwater channels, this interference is then utilized to protect the source location privacy. Further, to reduce the channel interference on the source packet, the time slot control is added to weaken the influence. Last, the ant colony algorithm is adopted for the data collection of AUV. The simulation results show that the MCISLP can increase the network safety time by up to 57$\%$ (compared with data collection algorithms), and balance the energy consumption of nodes (for about 20$\%$ energy saving), with a minor compromise of energy consumption of AUV and delay.

AB  - Monitoring the wear debris in lubricant systems is an effective method of reflecting the health of mechanical equipment. With the advantages of being simply structured, non-invasive, and insensitive to oil quality, inductive sensors are often deployed for debris detection. However, induced voltages generated by wear debris are usually contaminated by noise and other undesired components, thereby limiting the reliability and availability of the sensors. In this study, a new debris-detection framework is proposed based on an inductive sensor with parallel dual coils. With the aid of a reference signal, a multi least-mean-square adaptive weighting filtering method was developed, and good noise suppression was achieved with little violation of the debris signatures. The algorithm is illustrated through numerical simulations, and the effectiveness of the proposed framework was verified by an oil experiment. Two traditional denoising algorithms were also analyzed for comparison. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed strategy had an excellent capability for extracting and identifying debris features.

To address this challenge, we propose a deep learning-based framework that integrates single-channel noise reduction and multi-channel source localization. In this framework we suppress the ego-noise and estimate a time-frequency soft ratio mask with a single-channel deep neural network (DNN). Then we design two downstream multi-channel source localization algorithms, based on Steered Response Power (SRP-DNN) and Time-Frequency Spatial filtering (TFS-DNN). The main novelty lies in the proposed TFS-DNN approach, which estimates the presence probability of the target sound at individual time-frequency bins by combining the DNN-inferred soft ratio mask and the instantaneous direction of arrival of the sound received by the microphone array. The time-frequency presence probability of the target sound is then used to design a set of spatial filters to construct a spatial likelihood map for source localization. By jointly exploiting spectral and spatial information, TFS-DNN robustly processes signals in short segments (e.g. 0.5 seconds) in dynamic and low signal-noise-ratio scenarios (e.g. SNR -20 dB). Results on real and simulated data in a variety of scenarios (static sources, moving sources and moving drones) indicate the advantage of TFS-DNN over competing methods, including SRP-DNN and the state-of-the-art time-frequency spatial filtering.

AB  - Several recent studies have attempted to fully replace the conventional camera image signal processing (ISP) pipeline with convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, the previous CNN-based ISPs, simply referred to as ISP-Nets, have not explicitly considered that images have to be lossy-compressed in most cases, especially by the off-the-shelf JPEG. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a novel compression-aware deep camera ISP learning framework. At first, we introduce a new use case of compression artifacts simulation network (CAS-Net), which operates in the opposite way of commonly used compression artifacts reduction networks. Then, the CAS-Net is connected with an ISP-Net such that the ISP network can be trained with consideration of image compression. Throughout experimental studies, we show that our compression-aware camera ISP network can produce images with a better tradeoff between bit-rate and image quality compared to its compression-agnostic version when the performance is evaluated after JPEG compression.

AB  - A novel 96-channel ASIC for simultaneous recording of sEMG signals for muscle fatigue monitoring is presented. Each channel is fully differential such that information regarding the median frequency (MDF) of the sEMG signal can be extracted which has been shown to correlate with muscle fatigue. The analogue front-end of each channel includes a tunable band pass filter and a programmable variable gain, consumes 8.4μW and occupies an area of 0.034mm2. Additionally, the ASIC incorporates compressed sensing (CS) to reduce the data transmitted from all channels into rates achievable using Bluetooth technology. Each on-chip CS module occupies 0.0085mm2 and consumes 17μW per channel with a compression ratio of 10. The reconstructed signal achieves a SNRrecon of 10.2dB and a MARD of 1.7% for the MDF of the sEMG signal, validated using real sEMG recordings. The system architecture is designed in a modular way to ensure scalability for 100+ channels. As such, the system comprises 4 independent readout modules of 24-channels each which include a dedicated multiplexer, ADC and a compressed sensing module for each. The full ASIC is designed in a 0.35 μm CMOS process, occupies an area of 5.82mm2 and has a total power consumption of 3.93mW.

AB  - In the health monitoring of rotating machinery, there often coexists multiple fault sources; thus a multi-source composite fault signal will be collected by sensors. Moreover, the vibration signal of rotating machinery is usually submerged by the environmental noise in practical engineering occasions. These increase the difficulty of separation from the composite fault signal. However, the effect of traditional wavelet analysis method for denoising to enhance features of fault signal is limited, because of the energy dispersion of fault signals. To overcome these problems, we propose a convolutive blind separation method based on peak transform using wavelet analysis. With this strategy, the original signal energy in high frequency is concentrated into that in low frequency band, through some non-linear transformations. Next, the large wavelet coefficients, which represent the main features of the signal, are retained to reconstruct a feature-enhanced signal. The convolutive fixed-point algorithm based on maximization of non-Gaussianity, is carried out to separate source signals from the feature-enhanced signal. Experimental results of rolling bearing show that the proposed strategy can effectively separate source fault signals from the composite signal and detect the fault features.

AB  - The high rate of false alarms in intensive care units (ICUs) is one of the top challenges of using medical technology in hospitals. These false alarms are often caused by patients' movements, detachment of monitoring sensors, or different sources of noise and interference that impact the collected signals from different monitoring devices. In this paper, we propose a novel set of high-level features based on unsupervised feature learning technique in order to effectively capture the characteristics of different arrhythmia in electrocardiogram (ECG) signal and differentiate them from irregularity in signals due to different sources of signal disturbances. This unsupervised feature learning technique, first extracts a set of low-level features from all existing heart cycles of a patient, and then clusters these segments for each individual patient to provide a set of prominent high-level features. The objective of the clustering phase is to enable the classification method to differentiate between the high-level features extracted from normal and abnormal cycles (i.e., either due to arrhythmia or different sources of distortions in signal) in order to put more attention to the features extracted from abnormal portion of the signal that contribute to the alarm.

AB  - In this paper, a three-dimensional (3-D) indoor positioning system (IPS) is designed to realize positioning target, by taking advantage of high precision ranging of Ultra-wide bandwidth (UWB) sensor. The 3-D IPS is composed of UWB sensor, Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi) module and Control Station where the proposed algorithm is running to calculate the position of the moving target. To reduce ranging time as well as clock bias of UWB sensor, the Asymmetry Double-Sided Two-Way Ranging (ADS-TWR) algorithm is proposed. Then, according to the Time Difference of Arrival (TDoA) model, we obtain the TDoA equation. Furthermore, by taking advantage of the ability of quickly getting estimation location of the Chan algorithm and the ability of filtering noise and interference of Extended Kalman filter (EKF), Chan-EKF algorithm is proposed to accurately estimate the 3-D locations of moving target. Experimental and simulation results show that the developed IPS applying with the proposed ADS-TWR algorithm as well as the Chan-EKF algorithm can achieve faster and more accurate position estimations.

AB  - Sparse support recovery from multiple measurement vectors (MMV) is studied in this letter. For years, a noticeable mismatch exists between the theories and algorithms in the research of super-resolution and direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation that variants of separation conditions are assumed to ensure stable recovery while the corresponding algorithms rarely exploit such structural constraints. Due to the discrete nature of the separation condition, we propose to incorporate such prior information in a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) problem with an $\ell _{0}$-based constraint. We develop a specialized branch and bound (B&B) algorithm that can efficiently exploit the separation prior with guaranteed complexity reduction. Moreover, we show that computational complexity can be further reduced by leveraging the sparse array idea along with a particular perspective formulation of the MIP. The superior performance of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated via numerical experiments.

AB  - This paper describes a modernization effort to a critical subsystem onboard NASA's Enhanced MODIS Airborne Simulator (eMAS). A new Blackbody Temperature Controller subsystem greatly improves eMAS' infrared-imaging calibration and offers substantial gains in measurement and control performance. Reductions in Size, Weight and Power (SWaP) over prior instrument hardware are also achieved. Real-time control from the ground via the NASA Airborne Science Sensor Net is enabled by the ARM-based, embedded controller. A linear-drive stage delivers 140W peak power to a Thermoelectric Cooler (TEC) array for the blackbody. The paper details the rationale for selection of a linear power stage and corresponding analyses and prototyping that traded PWM versus linear methods. Linear drive is often considered grossly inefficient; a deeper analysis and novel packaging techniques indicate otherwise for this specific application. A survey of high-performance, temperature-measurement techniques reveals that new System-on-Chip (SoC) offerings substantially reduce complexity over prior state-of-the-art with little compromise in performance. Packaging volume of the new technology also radically shrinks. Lab results indicate measurement readout-noise (15mK, 3σ) improvements over legacy eMAS hardware. Selection of the temperature sensor and NIST-traceable calibration yields an overall systematic error of 60mK typical, 141mK worst-case. A full measurement system error budget is presented. The measurement stability aids performance and tuning of the control algorithm, also discussed. Two controllers have been built and integrated into the instrument in preparation for the upcoming deployment season. The new development is best understood in the context of the eMAS whiskbroom imager, its infrared capability, and the implementation of its blackbody infrared references. The blackbodies are built using circular plates of copper, coated with a special, high-emissivity paint that appears diffuse at infrared wavelengths. A pair of references on either side of the spectrometer's field of view provides an in-system, two-point calibration every scan line. An array of TEC modules is sandwiched between each plate and a forced-air cooled heatsink. A single sensor is read out at high precision with room for a coarse, auxiliary channel. Historically, temperature readout and control of these references were performed with a system mounted far from the spectrometer optical bench. Low-level analog signals were sent over long (10') cables in close proximity to the TEC array's high-current drive. This rendered the temperature measurement highly susceptible to systematic noise. The legacy system also utilized an analog control loop that could not be tuned or modified over time. The new controller leverages modern embedded system techniques to radically shrink the packaging volume and enable real-time control. Low-noise methods and clever thermal management allow the controller to be placed in close proximity to the reference plate. The overall result is an improvement in performance, reduction in system volume, and a drop in weight. Aircraft managers always welcome a weight reduction for airborne sensors; however, the eMAS technicians tasked with repeatedly installing the system are the real beneficiaries. Overall, the modernization effort represents a major step forward for this unique NASA Airborne Science asset.

Then reconstruct the ECG signals with different reconstruction algorithms. The experiment proves that the system has the characteristics of high precision, low power consumption and portable power saving.

AB  - Most consumer-grade digital cameras can only capture a limited range of luminance in real-world scenes due to sensor constraints. Besides, noise and quantization errors are often introduced in the imaging process. In order to obtain high dynamic range (HDR) images with excellent visual quality, the most common solution is to combine multiple images with different exposures. However, it is not always feasible to obtain multiple images of the same scene and most HDR reconstruction methods ignore the noise and quantization loss. In this work, we propose a novel learning-based approach using a spatially dynamic encoder-decoder network, HDRUNet, to learn an end-to-end mapping for single image HDR reconstruction with denoising and dequantization. The network consists of a UNet-style base network to make full use of the hierarchical multi-scale information, a condition network toperform pattern-specific modulation and a weighting network for selectively retaining information. Moreover, we propose a Tanh_L1 loss function to balance the impact of over-exposed values and well-exposed values on the network learning. Our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance in quantitative comparisons and visual quality. The proposed HDRUNet model won the second place in the single frame track of NITRE2021 High Dynamic Range Challenge. The code is available at https://github.com/chxy95/HDRUNet.

AB  - In-network data compression plays an important role in the elimination of redundant time-series data in a wireless sensor network (WSN). Inconsistency of data and high computational process in cluster formation remain to be challenging issues of in-network data compression particularly for energy-constraint WSNs. This paper develops a new data clustering technique for in-network data preprocessing and compression called Error-Control Truncated Singular Value Decomposition (ETSVD) to achieve online outlier detection and adaptive data compression. The ETSVD is divided into two modules which are Adaptive Recursive Outlier Detection and Smoothing (ARODS) and Adaptive Data Compression (DC). Firstly, the ARODS pre-processes the collected data for outlier detection and smoothing in order to improve the data quality. Secondly, the DC decomposes the pre-processed data into vector space to compress the spatio-temporal correlated data based on the predefined error threshold at the sending end. After the compression of correlated data, the distinct decomposed data are reconstructed at the receiver end which is performed offline. The simulation results show that the proposed technique is able to compress 91.49% of spatio-temporal environmental temperature data with reconstruction error having a minimum tolerance of $\pm 1.0^\circ $ C. The performance improvement of ETSVD in terms of error and accuracy compared to the performance of conventional SVD are 85.26% and 33.49%, respectively. Moreover, the ETSVD provides efficient error-control data preprocessing and compression solutions within the networks with minimum space and time complexities.

AB  - The adaptive data rate (ADR) algorithm is used in LoRaWAN, allocating an appropriate transmission rate for terminal equipment to improve channel utilization and reduce power consumption. However, the standard ADR algorithm is only suitable for static terminal equipment. In addition, due to the complexity of the external environment, the selected data rate will not match the new environment and communication packets will be lost. Therefore, this article proposed a novel and more effective ADR algorithm called new-dynamic ADR (ND-ADR). The algorithm mainly solves two problems, i.e., the standard ADR algorithm cannot be applied to mobile terminal devices and the poor communication quality and high packet loss rate in harsh environments. In this study, we also developed a frame for LoRaWAN (FLoRaWAN), a simulation framework for the star network topology LoRaWAN in OPNET. Furthermore, we built an OKUMURA–HATA model and additionally introduced a noise factor  $\beta$  to simulate the loss of wireless communication in harsh environments. Finally, extensive simulation results showed that the number of data packets required by different end nodes for rate allocation was different. Compared with the standard ADR algorithm, even for mobile nodes in harsh environments, the ND-ADR algorithm reduced network energy consumption by about 13%, reduced network delay by about 18%, and increased effective throughput by about 15%. Therefore, the improved ND-ADR algorithm is more suitable for wireless communication of removable nodes in harsh environments. Its advantages are better awareness of link environment, faster data rate regulation, improved channel utilization, and further reduction of network energy consumption.

AB  - Appropriate power control algorithm can increase total network rate and reduce energy consumption through optimizing signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) received by users. Thus it is vital for heterogeneous cellular networks, which are composed of macro base stations (BSs) and micro BSs. However, most existing power control schemes neglect the dynamic traffic variation and backhaul bandwidth constraint due to the variability of wireless traffic and difficulty of problem solving. This results in the performance reduction and resource waste under the highly dynamic traffic. In view of this, we propose an intelligent power control algorithm based on accurate traffic prediction. First, hybrid prediction scheme, composed of long short term memory (LSTM) and historical average value (HAV), is used to predict the traffic demand of each BS. Based on the predicted results, we propose a power control scheme. It achieves a weighted tradeoff between the total network rate and energy consumption under the consideration of backhaul constraint. By using the properties of concave function and the function structure of backhaul constraint, the Marks-Wright algorithm and difference of two convex functions (DC) programming are respectively employed to solve the non-convex optimization model approximately and accurately. Simulation results demonstrate that the prediction accuracy of proposed scheme is 3.73% and 6.03% higher than that of the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and support vector machine (SVM) algorithm, respectively. Compared with full power transmission, energy consumption of the proposed algorithm is reduced by 58.29%, while total network rate is increased by 3.26%.

AB  - In this paper, we propose a trajectory reconstruction method based on low-cost Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) in smartphones. The IMU used in our work consists of a three-axis accelerometer and a three-axis gyroscope, which can record information of acceleration and rotation, respectively. Since intrinsic bias and random noise usually cause unreliable IMU signals, filtering methods are utilized to reduce high- or low-frequency noises of the signals. In addition, to more accurately detect whether the smartphone is moving or not, we extract multiple features from IMU signals and train a movement detection model based on linear discriminant analysis (LDA). Then, a “reset switch” mechanism is applied when the smartphone is detected as in a static state. The “reset switch” mechanism can effectively restrain the accumulated error of displacement calculation. Finally, the trajectory reconstruction results are applied to handwritten letter recognition for English alphabet, and the experimental results show that our proposed trajectory reconstruction method is reliable.

AB  - In this investigation, we focus on the problem of mapping the ground reflectivity with multiple laser scanners mounted on mobile robots/vehicles. The problem originates because regions of the ground become populated with a varying number of reflectivity measurements, whose value depends on the observer and its corresponding perspective. Here, we propose a novel automatic, data-driven computational mapping framework specifically aimed at preserving edge sharpness in the map reconstruction process and that considers the sources of measurement variation. Our new formulation generates map-perspective gradients and applies sub-set selection fusion and de-noising operators to these through iterative algorithms that minimize an ℓ1 sparse regularized least squares formulation. The reconstruction of the ground reflectivity is then carried out based on Poisson's formulation posed as an ℓ2 term promoting consistency with the fused gradient of map-perspectives and a term that ensures equality constraints with reference measurement map data. We demonstrate that our new framework outperforms the capabilities of the existing ones with experiments realized on Ford's fleet of autonomous vehicles. For example, we show that we can achieve map enhancement (i.e., contrast enhancement), artifact removal, de-noising, and map-stitching without requiring an additional reflectivity adjustment to calibrate sensors to the specific mounting and robot/vehicle motion.

AB  - Smart traffic congestion reduction is useful for reducing the traffic in a highly congested area. To prevent heavy traffic Internet of things is implemented through a small device called a sensor, this technology is called smart traffic. A small device is placed near the roadside street post to detect the vehicle count. Smart traffic works by collecting the various signals like WiFi, Bluetooth, ZigBee from various electronic gadgets like a smartphone, smartwatch, smart band, tablet. The MAC address from each vehicle is collected as input information and stored in a cloud platform. Analyze and calculate the collected data set and performed it under machine learning prediction algorithms to get a better accuracy result to avoid traffic congestion. The logistic regression algorithm gives a 91% of accuracy level in traffic. It gives the shortest route to reach the destination without any hurdles. Results are reduced the traveling time, noise pollution, carbon dioxide emission, reach the destination on correct time and also save the fuel.

AB  - Filtering images using a guidance signal, a process called guided or joint image filtering, has been used in various tasks in computer vision and computational photography, particularly for noise reduction and joint upsampling. This uses an additional guidance signal as a structure prior, and transfers the structure of the guidance signal to an input image, restoring noisy or altered image structure. The main drawbacks of such a data-dependent framework are that it does not consider structural differences between guidance and input images, and that it is not robust to outliers. We propose a novel SD (for static/dynamic) filter to address these problems in a unified framework, and jointly leverage structural information from guidance and input images. Guided image filtering is formulated as a nonconvex optimization problem, which is solved by the majorize-minimization algorithm. The proposed algorithm converges quickly while guaranteeing a local minimum. The SD filter effectively controls the underlying image structure at different scales, and can handle a variety of types of data from different sensors. It is robust to outliers and other artifacts such as gradient reversal and global intensity shift, and has good edge-preserving smoothing properties. We demonstrate the flexibility and effectiveness of the proposed SD filter in a variety of applications, including depth upsampling, scale-space filtering, texture removal, flash/non-flash denoising, and RGB/NIR denoising.

AB  - The burgeoning networked computing devices create many distributed systems and generate new signals on a large scale. Many Internet of Things (IoT) applications, such as peer-to-peer streaming of multimedia data, crowdsourcing, and measurement by sensor networks, can be modeled as a form of big data. Processing massive data calls for new data structures and algorithms different from traditional ones designed for small-scale problems. For measurement from networked distributed systems, we consider an essential data format: signals on graphs. Due to limited computing resources, the sensor nodes in the distributed systems may outsource the computing tasks to third parties, such as cloud platforms, arising a severe concern on data privacy. A de-facto solution is to have third parties only process encrypted data. We propose a novel and efficient privacy-preserving secure outsourced computation protocol for denoising signals on the graph based on the information-theoretic secure multi-party computation (ITS-MPC). Denoising the data makes paths for further meaningful data processing. From experimenting with our algorithms in a testbed, the results indicate a better efficiency of our approach than a counterpart approach with computational security.

AB  - Chronic heart failure (CHF) is a worldwide disease that affects more than 26 million people in the developed world. Tracking complications such as cardiovascular failure patients could be used to act in a preventative manner, to improve early diagnosis, and to avoid the need for hospitalisation or even life threatening circumstances, thereby significantly enhancing the patient’s overall quality of life. The most current improvements in computer-aided, heart sound recognition technologies have been examined in this system, which has been in operation for the past decade. This research investigates approaches for detecting CHF based on the heart sounds produced by the patient. The perception of heart rate, as well as the relationship between heart sounds and cardiovascular disease, are important considerations. The basic techniques used in the processing and interpretation of cardiac signals seem to be de-noising, categorization, extraction, feature extraction, and classification, among others. Because of the emphasis on the usage of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms for analysing heart sounds, classic Machine-Learning (ML) technologies are merged with IoT end-to-end technologies, and both are integrated with a wide range of defined techniques. The primary goal of this study is to examine the many technologies that are comprised of the internet of things that are used to forecast heart attack disease and how they are used. It is the purpose of this study not only to explain the existing heart attack prediction, but also to address the aware and monitoring system for the patient who is likely to be suffering from cardiovascular illness. In this work, certain types of literature are reviewed and a survey on approaches for predicting heart attack occurrences in the future has been conducted.

AB  - The lunar hyperspectral remote sensing is one of the most important means to understand the physical properties and chemical constituents of lunar surface materials. Moon Mineral Mapper (M3) is currently the only hyperspectral image (HSI) data of Moon. However, due to the limitations of sensor manufacture and the impact of complex extraterrestrial environment, there are serious stripes on the M3 images, which do harm to subsequent identifications and analysis. In this paper, an effective destriping algorithm for lunar HSIs based on the intrinsic characteristics of the stripes on M3 is proposed. Experimental results demonstrate that our method shows an improvement in terms of visual perception and spectral fidelity.

To our knowledge, this is the first launch in speaker diarization domain which aims to evaluate the performance of the state-of-the-art system in realistic adverse acoustic environments. Besides speech preprocessing modules including speech denoising and speech activity detection, our attention has been focused on back-end clustering algorithms, especially in system fusion. Consensus clustering is adopt to combine both original speech and denoised speech, for purifying unreliable clusters. Moreover, a score-level fusion is conducted between GMM-UBM-based i-vector and CNN-based i-vector. Finally, our system achieves diarization error rates (DERs) of 36.05% on the evaluation sets, which is the second place in the DIHARD challenge.

AB  - Identification of the type of communication technology and/or modulation scheme based on detected radio signal are challenging problems encountered in a variety of applications including spectrum allocation and radio interference mitigation. They are rendered difficult due to a growing number of emitter types and varied effects of real-world channels upon the radio signal. Existing spectrum monitoring techniques are capable of acquiring massive amounts of radio and real-time spectrum data using compact sensors deployed in a variety of settings. However, state-of-the-art methods that use such data to classify emitter types and detect communication schemes struggle to achieve required levels of accuracy at a computational efficiency that would allow their implementation on low-cost computational platforms. In this paper, we present a learning framework based on an LSTM denoising auto-encoder designed to automatically extract stable and robust features from noisy radio signals, and infer modulation or technology type using the learned features. The algorithm utilizes a compact neural network architecture readily implemented on a low-cost computational platform while exceeding state-of-the-art accuracy. Results on realistic synthetic as well as over-the-air radio data demonstrate that the proposed framework reliably and efficiently classifies received radio signals, often demonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

AB  - Ongoing research in emission reduction requires accurate load detection for combustion engines with a limited number of sensors. Therefore, fast estimation of load temperature is essential. Temperature measurements are influenced by the thermal properties of the sensor itself as well as its position and mounting method. In this paper, the transient thermal behavior of the engine's crankcase and the temperature sensor for load detection is modeled as a low-pass transfer function. The unknown parameters of the transfer function are identified from experimental measurements. Maximum likelihood estimation and Kalman filtering are used to estimate the original temperature from disturbed measurements. Estimator performance is evaluated via simulations of randomized test scenarios in a Monte Carlo fashion. Influences of the model errors, the measurement noise and the estimation window-time are investigated.

AB  - This paper proposes cyclostationary feature detection (CFD) based spectrum sensor for cognitive radio technology that consumes lower hardware resources and delivers shorter sensing time. We have addressed the challenge of efficiently implementing complex frequency-domain based CFD spectrum-sensing algorithm. Specifically, VLSI-architecture of 2048-point FFT module has been multi-level resource shared for the optimization. In addition, performance analyses results of our spectrum sensor are presented for 1024, 2048 and 4096 point FFT sizes where the proposed design delivered adequate detection-probability of 0.9 at -5 dB of SNR. This spectrum sensor is FPGA implemented and it showed that the hardware utilization has been improved due to 100% reduction in memory requirement and has archived a shorter sensing time of 0.4 ms which is 12.5× lesser compared to the state-of-the-art work.

AB  - In the process of using space bearing, there are some problems such as the difficulty in identifying reliability characteristics, and the lack of fault diagnosis methods. Firstly, based on the reliability enhancement test principle, the temperature stress step test under standard atmospheric pressure and the vacuum degree step test at the use temperature are designed, and a space bearing test system that meets the control and measurement requirements is constructed. Then, after collection of the vibration response data under the condition of 0r/min and 1000r/min rotation speed, the wavelet energy spectrum of time-frequency data, which is the reliability characteristics, are identified using EEMD algorithm for data fusion and de-noising to study the fault state that reliability characteristics change with stress. Next, with the vibration response data of different running moments, data fusion de-noising and amplitude feature extraction are carried based on Hilbert transform. By obtaining the energy distribution of amplitude features in different frequency segments by fast Fourier transform, which is the reliability characteristic, the fault state of reliability characteristics over time is studied. Finally, through the simulation analysis, the mechanism and law of the corresponding fault state are identified, and the diagnostic relationship between the fault state and the simulation mechanism identified by the test is established, which can provide support to the on-orbit health monitoring and fault management.

AB  - In distributed wireless networks, the adaptation process depends on the information being shared between various nodes. The global minimum, is therefore, likely to be affected when the information shared between the nodes gets corrupted. This could happen due to several reasons namely link failure, noisy environment and erroneous data etc. In this research, we propose a computationally efficient robust incremental least mean square (RILMS) algorithm to resolve the aforementioned issues. Essentially, a fusion step is introduced in the framework of the incremental least mean square (ILMS). Prior to adaptation at a node, the information shared by the neighbouring node is fused with the temporally preceding information of the node using an efficient combiner. An adaptive fusion strategy is proposed resulting in dynamic weight assignment for the fusion step. Closed form expression for the steady-state excess mean square error (EMSE) is derived and the performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated for the noisy link environments and compared to the existing algorithms. Extensive experiments show the efficacy of the proposed approach compared to the contemporary methods. The proposed algorithm is found to be robust against the link failure and local node divergence problems. The improved performance of the proposed RILMS algorithm comes with a significant reduction in computational complexity compared to the convex combination based ILMS (CILMS) approach.

AB  - In this paper, we investigate dynamic channel se- lection in short-range Wireless Isochronous Real Time (WIRT) in-X subnetworks aimed at supporting fast closed-loop control with super-short communication cycle (below 0.1 ms) and extreme reliability (>99.999999%). We consider fully distributed approaches in which each subnetwork selects a channel group for transmission in order to guarantee the requirements based solely on its local sensing measurements without the possibility for exchange of information between subnetworks. We present three fully distributed schemes: $\epsilon$-greedy channel allocation, minimum SINR guarantee (minSINR) and Nearest Neighbor Conflict Avoidance (NNCA) based on measurements of the minimum SINR and interference power. We further apply a centralized graph coloring scheme as a baseline for evaluating performance of the proposed distributed algorithms. Performance evaluation considering subnetwork mobility and spatio-temporal correlated channel models shows that the dynamic allocation schemes results in significant performance improvement and a reduction in the bandwidth required for supporting such extreme connectivity by up to a factor larger than 2 relative to static channel assignment.

AB  - The security is an essential requirement in this digital world, and the main challenge is to have an effective authentication system for access control. In the paper, the ECG based biometrics system is implemented for the connected health systems or Body Sensor Area Networks (BANs). The proposed approach is based on wavelet thresholding and Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition to minimize the effects of the presence of various noises and artifacts in signal. The implementation of the proposed algorithm is carried out on the Zynq SoC (Zybo Zynq-7000(xc7z010clg400) prototyping board) to validate the real-time performance of the system. The results are carried out on MITBIH Normal Sinus Rhythm Database. The feature extraction methods singular value decomposition and eigen decomposition of the proposed algorithm are implemented on FPGA. K Nearest Neighbour Classifier is used for identification purposes. The False Measure rates, i.e., FAR and FRR were found to be 2.35% and 1% respectively, which are better in comparison to previous work. The proposed system has excellent classification accuracy (99.5%) for ECG based authentication.

AB  - In this paper, we present a real-time quality-aware pulse waveform delineation and parameter extraction method for accurate and reliable measurements of pulse parameters from photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals. It consists of three major stages: the PPG signal quality assessment (PPG-SQA) using autocorrelation function (ACF) and number of threshold-crossings (NTC) features, the zero-frequency resonator (ZFR) based pulse onset and peak determination, and the pulse parameter extraction. The method is implemented on the Arduino Due with a 32-bit Atmel SAM3X8E ARM Cortex-M3 CPU, 512-kB flash memory, 96-kB SRAM, and 84-MHz clock speed. The method is evaluated on the recorded PPG signals and three standard PPG databases. The PPG-SQA algorithm achieves an average sensitivity (Se) = 98.62%, specificity (Sp) = 97.37%, and overall accuracy (OA) = 98.09%. The algorithm achieves an average Se = 99.88%, positive predictivity (Pp) = 99.89, Se = 99.82%, and Pp = 99.95%, respectively with the delineation errors (mean ± standard deviation) of 8.45 ± 9.39 ms and 0.23 ± 1.33 ms for finding onsets and peaks, respectively. The statistical analysis demonstrates that the parameter measurement errors are minimum for most of the pulse cycles. Results show that our quality-aware PPG analysis scheme can achieve a false alarm rate reduction (FARR) of 97.36% which outperforms the other existing SQA algorithms. It can lead to save transmission and processing energy from 8.33% to 95.63% and 8.33% to 59.77% for a duration from 5 to 60 s, respectively. The method has great potential for low-energy IoT and unsupervised health monitoring devices.

AB  - Compressed sensing is now regarded as an effective method for dimension reduction during signal acquisition. One significant, yet under-addressed issue regarding the transmission of compressively sensed images is how to compress and code measurements, the output of a compressed sensing sensor. As the spatially adjacent correlation in the measurement domain is weak, conventional encoding algorithms cannot be applied directly for measurements. In this paper, we propose the adjacent pixels based measurement coding system (APMC) to generate compressed image bit-streams. Firstly, an adjacent pixels based measurement matrix (APMM) is applied to embed the pixel-domain boundary information of each block to the measurement domain. By adopting APMM, the pixel-domain information can be efficiently used for measurement-domain intra prediction. Moreover, to avoid the interference of pixels that are far apart and achieve a high prediction accuracy, we employ boundary measurements of neighboring blocks as references for prediction. Finally, we propose a rate control algorithm to process the residuals between measurements and predictions, to generate a coded bit sequence for transmitting. Experimental results demonstrated superiority in rate-distortion performance and bandwidth costs in transmitting as compared to previous schemes. Compared to the state-of-the-art, this work achieves a 24% decrease in bitrate and a 1.68 dB increase in Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) on average.

AB  - Myoelectric pattern recognition is widely used to control upper limb prostheses. However, the non-stationary characteristics of electromyography (EMG) signals, caused by physiological changes (e.g. muscle fatigue) or non-physiological changes (e.g. the electrode- skin impedance), hinder the use of prostheses and deteriorate the performance of the myoelectric control system. In this paper, a set of robust features is proposed to be integrated with adaptive learning techniques in order to improve the myoelectric performance. Four types of features are proposed, namely the H, HI, AI, and AIH features. The H features correspond to the histogram-oriented gradient (HOG) algorithm of the High-Density surface Electromyography map (HD-sEMG map). On the other hand, the HI features are generated by combining the H features and the intensity feature that is evaluated from the HD-sEMG map. AI is the intensity features calculated from the segmented HD-sEMG maps constructed in the individual channel. Finally, AIH features are obtained by combining the H features and AI features. Offline and online adaptive tests are conducted to evaluate the proposed features. The results show that employing the proposed AI features with an adaptive classifier improves the classification accuracy from 91.58% to 97.2% in online classification setups. Results also show that the AI features are more robust against noise than TD features. The average classification accuracy is reduced by 0.7% when additive White Gaussian noise is applied, in comparison to 5.8% reduction in accuracy when TD features is used. The results confirm the robustness of the proposed features extracted from the HD-sEMG map.

AB  - Ampacity is defined as the maximum current carrying capacity of an electrical conductor without compromising its physical integrity. A possible methodology for the monitoring of this parameter in transmission lines consists in the distribution of punctual temperature sensors along the line. This paper presents the development of electronic instrumentation for a current and temperature monitoring equipment to be applied in 230 kV power transmission lines. The chosen current transducer is the Rogowski Coil because of its linear response and decoupling between the measurement and power circuits, while the chosen temperature transducer is the NTC (Negative Temperature Coefficient) thermistor because of its low cost and high sensitivity. The developed prototype dos not use batteries or solar panels as power supply, as it is energized by the voltage induced in a secondary coil coupled to the transmission line. In order to increase the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and ensure electromagnetic compatibility (EMC), the hardware was developed and validated through numeric simulations and experimental measurements. Furthermore, digital noise reduction techniques such as oversampling and waveform averaging algorithms were implemented in the system. The developed equipment is theoretically able to measure electrical currents up to 1650 A, and was validated for currents up to 500 A and temperatures up to 90 °C. All collected data is transmitted to a computer for further analysis via wireless communication.

AB  - This paper elucidates a model for acoustic single and multi-tone classification in resource constrained edge devices. The proposed model is of State-of-the-art Fast Accurate Stable Tiny Gated Recurrent Neural Network. This model has resulted in improved performance metrics and lower size compared to previous hypothesized methods by using lesser parameters with higher efficiency and employment of a noise reduction algorithm. The model is implemented as an acoustic Al module, focused for the application of sound identification, localization, and deployment on Al systems like that of an autonomous car. Further, the inclusion of localization techniques carries the potential of adding a new dimension to the multi-tone classifiers present in autonomous vehicles, as its demand increases in urban cities and developing countries in the future.

AB  - Range detection is the key to solve localization, tracking, navigation and other applications. Several solutions, such as LIDAR range sensor, is commonly used to achieve range detection. Considering that the microwave Doppler radar has the advantages of being unaffected by humidity, temperature and light variation, so it is more suitable for complex environment. The paper proposed a Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) Doppler radar system to perform short range detection of the target. Several methods were considered to extract the range information. According to the principle of FMCW radar, beat signal can be analyzed. Due to the complexity of the working environment, the beat signal contains various noise jamming. In order to eliminate noise contained in the beat signal, wavelet denoising method with the adapted threshold function was considered. In the frequency domain analysis, traditional FFT causes fence effects. FFT and CZT joint algorithm is proposed to suppress the influence of fence effects and improves real-time performance. The experimental results based on above methods are included in the paper.

AB  - In this paper, we consider learning based regularization for compressive sensing reconstruction using focal plane array sensors. While many optimization algorithms employ proximal operators for regularization, they are often inadequate in fully capturing the characteristics of complex natural images. Recently, deep learning based approaches obtained promising results in different imaging problems, creating the possibility to use them for regularization in an optimization framework. Here, we utilize this approach in compressive sensing based spatial multiplexing cameras. This technique is motivated by the high cost of producing large focal plane arrays in infrared sensors. Reconstruction from undersampled measurements can be done using a spatial multiplexing camera which relies on multiple snapshots for super-resolving a scene. It acquires coded projections of a scene using a spatial light modulator and a low-resolution focal plane array. We first formulate the problem of finding a high resolution image from its undersampled measurements. Then, we develop a reconstruction method with learning based regularization to solve this problem using alternating direction method of multipliers framework. For this, we replace the proximal operator corresponding to the regularization function with a deep convolutional denoising network. We also enhance a previously proposed denoising network's training phase by introducing multiple noise realizations for each training patch, which results in better reconstruction performance. Numerical results for different imaging scenarios show successful recovery of high resolution images in terms of PSNR, SSIM and visual quality at significant noise levels.

AB  - Time difference of arrival (TDOA) localization technology, which does not require the time stamp of the source signals, is playing an increasingly important role in passive localization. Besides TDOA measurement noise and receiver position errors, another factor affecting TDOA positioning accuracy is the synchronization clock bias between different receivers. In this paper, the problem of TDOA source localization is considered under the condition that the TDOA measurements from multiple disjoint sources are subject to the same receiver position displacements and synchronization clock bias. First, based on the orthogonal projection matrix, the Cramér-Rao lower bounds of unknown parameters are derived in the presence of synchronization clock bias. Subsequently, according to the maximum likelihood (ML) criterion and Taylor series (TS) positioning method, the estimates obtained by ignoring the clock bias are shown to be biased, and the mean square error is found to increase quadratically with the 2-norm of the clock bias vector. To suppress the effect of synchronization clock bias, two dimension-reduction TS algorithms are proposed, and their asymptotically optimal performance is demonstrated under first-order error analysis. In addition, an ML-based closed-form solution for the clock bias vector is provided. Finally, simulation results verify the validity of the theoretical derivation and show the superiority of the proposed algorithms compared to the existing closed-form method.

AB  - Over-the-air computation (AirComp) provides a promising way to support ultrafast aggregation of distributed data. However, its performance cannot be guaranteed in long-distance transmission due to the distortion induced by the channel fading and noise. To unleash the full potential of AirComp, this paper proposes to use a low-cost unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) acting as a mobile base station to assist AirComp systems. Specifically, due to its controllable high-mobility and high-altitude, the UAV can move sufficiently close to the sensors to enable line-of-sight transmission and adaptively adjust all the links' distances, thereby enhancing the signal magnitude alignment and noise suppression. Our goal is to minimize the time-averaging mean-square error for AirComp by jointly optimizing the UAV trajectory, the scaling factor at the UAV, and the transmit power at the sensors, under constraints on the UAV’s predetermined locations and flying speed, sensors’ average and peak power limits. However, due to the highly coupled optimization variables and time-dependent constraints, the resulting problem is non-convex and challenging. We thus propose an efficient iterative algorithm by applying the block coordinate descent and successive convex optimization techniques. Simulation results verify the convergence of the proposed algorithm and demonstrate the performance gains and robustness of the proposed design compared with benchmarks.

AB  - Trajectory clustering aims at grouping similar trajectories into one cluster. It is an efficient way of finding the representative path or common trend shared by different moving objects, and also provides a foundation for movement pattern mining, anomaly detection and other applications. Existing trajectory clustering studies mainly rely on feature selection and similarity measurement based on their geographical and spatial properties. However, one obstacle hindering their wide usage is the problem of clustering accuracy in the presence of noisy or incomplete sensing data, due to limited sensory device quantity, communication errors, sensor failures, and sensor vacancy. This paper proposes an error-tolerant trajectory clustering approach by incorporating denoising methods.We propose the Robust Deep Attention Auto-encoders model (called Robust DAA) to learn the representations of low-dimensional denoising trajectories with three novel features. First, we present the deep attention auto-encoders by integrating the attention mechanism into the classical deep auto-encoder, which is capable of enhancing feature propagation and feature selection. Second, we train the deep attention auto-encoder by applying proximal method, back propagation and the Alternating Direction of Method of Multipliers (ADMM). As a result, our Robust DAA can reduce the negative influence of the noise on trajectory data. Finally, we perform clustering over the low-dimensional denoising representations using traditional clustering algorithms and demonstrates the quality of the clustering results by comparing our approach with existing representative methods. Extensive experiments are conducted on both synthetic datasets and real datasets. The results show that our approach outperforms the existing models in terms of accuracy, precision, recall and f1-score.

AB  - As an emerging technology, device-free localization (DFL), using radio frequency (RF) sensor networks to detect targets who do not carry any attached devices, has spawned extensive applications. Many existing works formulate DFL as a classification problem, and a key problem is how to extract discriminative features to characterize the raw wireless signal. In this paper, we present an autoencoder-based deep neural network for feature extraction, moreover, multiple Gaussian Bernoulli restricted Boltzmann machines (GBRBMs) are utilized for pre-training and dimension reduction. Experiment results show that this method of GBRBM-based autoencoder (GBRBM-AE) can achieve a high accuracy and efficient performance, which outperforms the conventional autoencoder. When the dimensions of input data are reduced from 784 to 20 dims, our algorithm can maintain a high accuracy of 97.1% and is robust to noise with SNR = 5dB.

AB  - Compressive sensing (CS) techniques have been proposed for wideband spectrum sensing applications to achieve sub-Nyquist-rate sampling. The complexity of CS recovery algorithm and the detection performance against noise are two of the main challenges of the implementation of compressive spectrum sensing (CSS). We hereby propose CSS scheme based on orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) with the aid of spectrum sparsity order estimation enabled by detecting the signal subspace dimensionality directly from sub- Nyquist measurements. The computational effort of spectrum recovery can be saved superlinearly with the reduction of iterations. With the estimated spectrum sparsity order, the OMP algorithm is proposed to run only an explicit and a fraction of iterations compared to the cases where such estimation is absent. Besides, the estimation of active channel number also enables blind and hard decision of channel occupancy where threshold adaption for energy detection is avoided. Moreover, the detection performance of the proposed CSS scheme by simulation shows superior robustness against noise compared to the energy detection scheme.

AB  - With the widespread of Human-Cyber-Physical Systems (HCPS), the fine-grained human movement detection becomes more and more important. Especially for the slightly motions of human’s hands, they are not only bring abundant information, but also provide a new way for the interaction between users and systems. In this paper, we focus on the problem of how to detect the human’s typing motion, and designed a new system, named as Typing Wristband, to obtain the vibration of wrist using piezoelectric transducer (PZT). Then, a robust denoising, event detection and classification algorithms are proposed to deal with the signal collected by Typing Wristband and detect the typing motions. Typing Wristband can recognized the movements of 3 fingers and 9 keys with high accuracy. Furthermore, it is very cheap and can be embedded into existing smart devices, e.g. a smart watch, so that it supports the wireless sensing very well in practice. Both of the analysis and experimental results verify that our Typing Wristband has the better performance in terms of accuracy and convenience.

AB  - The availability of large-scale datasets has helped unleash the true potential of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, for the single-image denoising problem, capturing a real dataset is an unacceptably expensive and cumbersome procedure. Consequently, image denoising algorithms are mostly developed and evaluated on synthetic data that is usually generated with a widespread assumption of additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). While the CNNs achieve impressive results on these synthetic datasets, they do not perform well when applied on real camera images, as reported in recent benchmark datasets. This is mainly because the AWGN is not adequate for modeling the real camera noise which is signal-dependent and heavily transformed by the camera imaging pipeline. In this paper, we present a framework that models camera imaging pipeline in forward and reverse directions. It allows us to produce any number of realistic image pairs for denoising both in RAW and sRGB spaces. By training a new image denoising network on realistic synthetic data, we achieve the state-of-the-art performance on real camera benchmark datasets. The parameters in our models are ~5 times lesser than the previous best method for RAW denoising. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the proposed framework generalizes beyond image denoising problem e.g., for color matching in stereoscopic cinema.

AB  - Aiming at the problem that the pedestrian navigation algorithm based on quadratic curve fitting zero-speed correction technology has low utilization rate of data samples and poor correction performance and instantaneous accuracy which cannot be optimized, an intelligent adaptive pedestrian navigation algorithm based on support vector machine is proposed, which the data of the sensors is obtained by using the optimized wavelet threshold denoising algorithm; the model trained by the SVR(support vector machine regression) is used to fit the three-dimensional velocity and the error fitting result is used as the system observations; then the intelligent estimator is formed by the SVM and the Kalman filter to estimate the system errors, thereby improving the system accuracy and reliability. The experimental verification by self-developed IMU proves that the method can accurately fit the three-dimensional velocity errors, estimate the systematic error optimally, and effectively correct the navigation data. The positioning accuracy is improved by 10.9% in complex environment. The algorithm has theoretical and engineering significance.

AB  - Gait recognition has gained increasing attention from biometric scholars because of its applications in video surveillance. A novel approach to recognize human gait is presented based on multi-feature fusion and nearest neighbor classifier. The developed method firstly extracts 3 kinds of features from gait skeletal data by exploiting Kinect followed by calculating distances between any 2 gait sequences corresponding to these features. In what follows, weighted summation can be applied to acquire one fusion that is used in nearest neighbor classifier to recognize any gait sequence. The effectiveness of this gait recognition algorithm is verified on UPCV gait database and the experimental results show that the method has encouraging recognition rate.

AB  - Higher requirements must be put forward about wireless signal transmission in harsh environments. Energy loss mitigation, channel estimation, noise interference reduction demands high quality of service in wireless communication. In the fifth generation wireless communication, massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) networks have been used and play a significant role to fulfill the requirements. Cell-Free massive MIMO networks are recognized as possible solution in the future wireless communication. Spectral efficiency (SE) is a very important index in assessing massive MIMO networks. This article tries to optimize both SE and power control of cell-free massive MIMO networks. Both uplink and downlink transmission are included in the study. The optimization model contains both SE and power control of massive MIMO networks. To tackle the model, a novel ensemble method is developed inspired by ensemble learning. The ensemble method is built up on the neighborhood field optimization method. The goodness of the developed ensemble method is verified by comparing with genetic algorithm, gradient descent method and Newton method. Extensive simulations are performed to study the optimization of SE and power control. Different wireless sensors are taken into consideration to simulate different requirements of massive MIMO networks. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for applying in massive MIMO networks.

This research paper proposed an advance spectrum sensing technique consist of wavelet fusion. Denoising and multi-resolution capabilities of wavelet processing are utilized to develop an effective cooperative sensing technique. The proposed algorithm is based on data fusion from different sensors using the wavelet transform, proceeded by wavelet de-noising and energy detection. The proposed algorithm is compared with a previously published algorithm that is based on hard decision fusion proceeded by wavelet processing in each individual sensor. In addition, the results are also compared with the classical cooperative energy detection technique. The results show that our proposed technique outperform previous techniques for a sample false alarm probability.

AB  - Speech enhancement is important for applications such as telecommunications, hearing aids, automatic speech recognition and voice-controlled system. The enhancement algorithms aim to reduce interfering noise while minimizing any speech distortion. In this work for speech enhancement, we propose to use polynomial matrices in order to exploit the spatial, spectral as well as temporal correlations between the speech signals received by the microphone array. Polynomial matrices provide the necessary mathematical framework in order to exploit constructively the spatial correlations within and between sensor pairs, as well as the spectral-temporal correlations of broadband signals, such as speech. Specifically, the polynomial eigenvalue decomposition (PEVD) decorrelates simultaneously in space, time and frequency. We then propose a PEVD-based speech enhancement algorithm. Simulations and informal listening examples have shown that our method achieves noise reduction without introducing artefacts into the enhanced signal for white, babble and factory noise conditions between -10 dB to 30 dB SNR.

AB  - Due to the imaging mechanism of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and the noise in the images, visual identification of objects in the scene is not as easy as in optical images. SAR images have limited color information and cannot reflect the spectral information of objects. Optical images, on the other hand, have rich spectral information. SAR-Optical image fusion is an important area of study so that SAR data can be easily evaluated by anyone, but it is difficult to find a matching SAR and optical image of the same scene. In order to overcome this difficulty, Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 datasets have been published and image fusion studies have been carried out with various methods. However, it has been observed that the effect of SAR noise removal before merging on image fusion methods has not been investigated. In the studies conducted to investigate this effect, five different fusion algorithms used in the literature were tested with twenty different image groups using different noise reduction ratios. The success of the fusion results obtained was compared with five different metrics that are widely used in the literature. The images and metric results obtained as a result of the tests showed that the removal of speckle noise in the SAR data has a positive effect on the fusion results.

AB  - The non-intrusive human activity recognition has been envisioned as a key enabler for many emerging applications requiring interactions between humans and computing systems. To accurately recognize different human behaviors, ubiquitous wireless signals are widely adopted, e.g., Wi-Fi signals, whose Channel State Information can precisely reflect human movements. Unfortunately, nearly all Wi-Fi-based recognition systems assume a clean wireless environment, i.e., no interference will compromise the developed algorithms, which, apparently, is not feasible in practice. Even worse, for systems using Wi-Fi 2.4GHz signals, the widely existing interference from coexisting protocols, such as ZigBee, Bluetooth, and LTE-Unlicensed, can easily compromise the recognition process, posing a hard limit on further enhancing the accuracy. Therefore, this work uncovers a new wireless adversarial attack against Wi-Fi-based human activity recognition systems, by intentionally injecting interference using coexisting protocol signals. The contaminated Wi-Fi signal will distort CSI estimation and finally output a false recognition result. Different from traditional jamming attacks, this new adversarial attack is intelligent and stealthy in terms of avoiding being detected from traffic analysis. Along with both theoretical analysis and extensive real-world experiments, we have shown this newly-identified attack can easily compromise many existing Wi-Fi-based human recognition systems while still bypassing malicious signal detection schemes.

AB  - Modern digital cameras rely on the sequential execution of separate image processing steps to produce realistic images. The first two steps are usually related to denoising and demosaicking, where the former aims to reduce noise from the sensor and the latter converts a series of light intensity readings to color images. Modern approaches try to jointly solve these problems, i.e., joint denoising-demosaicking, which is an inherently ill-posed problem given that two-thirds of the intensity information is missing and the rest is perturbed by noise. While there are several machine learning systems that have been recently introduced to solve this problem, the majority of them rely on generic network architectures, which do not explicitly consider the physical image model. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm that is inspired by powerful classical image regularization methods, large-scale optimization, and deep learning techniques. Consequently, our derived iterative optimization algorithm, which involves a trainable denoising network, has a transparent and clear interpretation compared with other black-box data driven approaches. Our extensive experimentation line demonstrates that our proposed method outperforms any previous approaches for both noisy and noise-free data across many different datasets. This improvement in reconstruction quality is attributed to the rigorous derivation of an iterative solution and the principled way we design our denoising network architecture, which as a result requires fewer trainable parameters than the current state-of-the-art solution, and furthermore can be efficiently trained by using a significantly smaller number of training data than existing deep demosaicking networks.

AB  - Channel estimation in hybrid analog-digital massive MIMO systems is a challenging problem due to the high channel dimension, low signal-to-noise ratio before beamforming, and reduced number of radio-frequency chains. Compressed sensing based algorithms have been adopted to address these challenges by leveraging the sparse nature of millimeter-wave MIMO channels. In compressed sensing-based methods, the training vectors should be designed carefully to guarantee recoverability. Although using random vectors has an overwhelming recoverability guarantee, it has been recently shown that an optimized update, which could be obtained so that the mutual coherence of the resulting sensing matrix is minimized, can improve the recoverability guarantee. In this paper, we propose an openloop hybrid analog-digital beam-training framework, where a given sensing matrix is decomposed into analog and digital beamformers. The given sensing matrix can be designed efficiently offline to reduce computational complexity. Simulation results show that the proposed training method achieves a lower mutual coherence and an improved channel estimation performance than the other benchmark methods.

AB  - In this paper, the particle filter problem is investigated for a class of nonlinear systems with communication constraints. The communication between sensor and remote filter is subject to uniform quantization effects. Moreover, in order to solve the problem of limited network capacity, the Round-Robin protocol is introduced in this paper, which can effectively avoid communication conflicts and reduce packet loss. Through mathematical hypothesis and stochastic analysis, an explicit expression of likelihood function combined with the probability information of networked phenomenon is established under the recursive Bayesian estimation framework. A novel particle filter algorithm is proposed for nonlinear state estimation in the simultaneous presence of uniform quantization and Round-Robin protocol. Finally, a simulation example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed particle filtering method.

AB  - Arising from various environmental and atmos- pheric conditions and sensor interference, spectral variations are inevitable during hyperspectral remote sensing, which degrade the subsequent hyperspectral image analysis significantly. In this paper, we propose simultaneous spatial and spectral low-rank representation (S3LRR) that can effectively suppress the within-class spectral variations for classification purposes. The S3LRR recovers an intrinsic component with the same dimension as the original image, in which both spatial and spectral low-rank priors are adopted to regularize the intrinsic component simultaneously and compensate to each other, together with robust modeling of spectral variations. Compared with existing methods that explore only the spectral low-rank prior, the novel spatial low-rank prior (i.e., low-rank prior in band-wise) can take the spatial structure information of hyperspectral images into account, which has demonstrated to be very useful. Technically, we formulate S3LRR as a constrained convex optimization problem, and solve it using the efficient inexact augmented Lagrangian multiplier method. The resulting intrinsic component is less interfered by within-class spectral variations, and more discriminatory to offer higher classification accuracy. Comprehensive experiments on benchmark data sets demonstrate that the proposed S3LRR improves classification accuracy significantly, which outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

AB  - This article considers distributed estimation of an unknown deterministic parameter vector in a bandwidth constrained multisensor network with a fusion center (FC). Due to the stringent bandwidth requirements, each sensor compresses its observation as a low-dimensional vector via a linear transformation. Then, the FC linearly combines all received compressed data to estimate the deterministic parameter vector based on the best linear unbiased estimator. The problem of interest is to jointly design the dimension assignment (i.e., the compression dimension of each sensor) and the corresponding compression matrix when the total number of compression dimensions is given. Such a joint design problem is formulated as an optimization problem with rank and linear matrix equality constraints, which is shown to be NP-hard for the first time. In addition, penalty decomposition (PD), successive quadratic upper-bound minimization method of multipliers (SQUM-M), and SQUM-M-block coordinate descent (SQUM-M-BCD) are proposed to solve it approximately. Furthermore, we show that any accumulation point of the sequence generated by the PD satisfies the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions of the equivalent formulation of the joint design problem; the SQUM-M admits the same convergence property as the PD under some conditions. Numerical experiments corroborate the merits of PD and SQUM-M-BCD as compared with existing strategies for the heterogeneous scenario, and further illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms for the correlated noise case.

AB  - The performance of cognitive radio network (CRN) is directly linked with presence of primary user. The major challenges of cognitive radio networks (CRN) are sensing of primary user by secondary user and cooperation among secondary user. The sensing of primary user can be controlled through spectrum sensing capabilities of secondary user while cooperation between secondary user become more complex with increasing secondary user in CRN. In this paper we have study existing method for sensing primary user by secondary user. Combine cluster based network and energy detection sensing method proposed that improves cooperation among secondary user and inherently reduces overhead. The result shows reduction in access time and increase the probability detection for CRN.

AB  - Using zero/pole design method, the proposed narrow band (NB) infinite impulse response band-pass filter (IIR-BPF) can be designed for coarse narrow spectrum sensing (NSS) algorithms with carrier aggregation (CA) capability to be employed in cognitive radio internet-of-things (CR-IoT) nodes. This IIR-BPF can extract the targeted physical radio resource blocks (PRBs) in the wide orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) aggregated bandwidth prior of performing the sensing process. The practical frequency response characteristics of the filter are addressed. The use of the suggested digital filter with energy detector (ED) shows sensing performance enhancement presented by probability or error reduction under noise power uncertainty and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). For instance, at SNR=-13 dB and for the same sample complexity (N=100), the probability of error is reduced from 0.67 to 0.48 using the proposed solution.

AB  - Tight integration algorithms fusing Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) and Inertial Navigation System (INS) have become popular in many high-accuracy positioning and navigation applications. Despite their reliability, common integration architectures can still run into accuracy drops under challenging navigation settings. The growing computational power of low-cost, embedded systems has allowed for the exploitation of several advanced Bayesian state estimation algorithms, such as the Particle Filter (PF) and its hybrid variants, e.g. Unscented Particle Filter (UPF). Although sophisticated, these architectures are not immune from multipath scattering and Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) signal receptions, which frequently corrupt satellite measurements and jeopardise GNSS/INS solutions. Hence, a certain level of modelling adaptivity should be granted to avoid severe drifts in the estimated states. Given these premises, the paper presents a novel Adaptive Unscented Particle Filter (AUPF) architecture leveraging two cascading stages to cope with disruptive, biased GNSS input observables in harsh conditions. A INS-based signal processing block is implemented upstream of a Redundant Measurement Noise Covariance Estimation (RMNCE) stage to strengthen the adaptation of observables’ statistics and improve the state estimation. An experimental assessment is provided for the proposed robust AUPF that demonstrates a 10 % average reduction of the horizontal position error above the 75-th percentile. In addition, a comparative analysis both with previous adaptive architectures and a plain UPF is carried out to highlight the improved performance of the proposed methodology.

AB  - Commercially available, wearable physiological monitors rely on rigid, multiple electronic components, coupled with aggressive adhesives and conductive gels, often causing discomfort and skin breakdown. Here, we introduce an all-in-one, wireless, stretchable bioelectronics platform for portable, real-time physiological monitoring and accurate classification biopotentials, including electrocardiograms (ECG), electroencephalograms (EEG), and electromyograms (EMG). The nanomembrane sensor and multi-layered electronic system is manufactured by integration of microfabrication techniques, aerosol jet printing of nanoparticles, photonic sintering, and hard-soft materials assembly. Strategic integration with hyperelastic elastomers allows the device to adhere and deform naturally with human body while maintaining the functionalities of the on-board electronics. Stretchable electrodes with optimized structures for intimate skin contact acquire high-quality biopotentials. Comparison of those signals with commercial systems captures the improved performance and significant noise reduction of the stretchable bioelectronics. Implementation of convolutional neural networks for real-time classifications of ECG, EMG, EEG and inertial measurement data demonstrates the feasibility for precise control of external systems. In vivo demonstrations with human subjects in various scenarios reveal the versatility of the device as both a health monitor with real-time cardiac monitoring and a viable human-machine interface.

AB  - Existing denoising methods typically restore clear results by aggregating pixels from the noisy input. Instead of relying on hand-crafted aggregation schemes, we propose to explicitly learn this process with deep neural networks. We present a spatial pixel aggregation network and learn the pixel sampling and averaging strategies for image denoising. The proposed model naturally adapts to image structures and can effectively improve the denoised results. Furthermore, we develop a spatio-temporal pixel aggregation network for video denoising to efficiently sample pixels across the spatio-temporal space. Our method is able to solve the misalignment issues caused by large motion in dynamic scenes. In addition, we introduce a new regularization term for effectively training the proposed video denoising model. We present extensive analysis of the proposed method and demonstrate that our model performs favorably against the state-of-the-art image and video denoising approaches on both synthetic and real-world data.

AB  - Taking advantage of different sensitivities of each component/material in an object to different bands, multispectral image (MSI) is obtained by shooting the object from multiple bands individually or simultaneously. Including these different complementary information with the space-time correlation, the MSI can describe the object more clearly and comprehensively. In practice, however, it is unavoidable that MSIs are corrupted by noise. In order to solve the denoising problem of MSIs, a framework is proposed to suppress noise by learning multiscale sparse representations of MSIs with an over-complete tensor dictionary. In our method, the tensor patches are extracted from an image tensor, and a tensor-based dictionary is trained using a special tensor decomposition, in which each atom is a rank-one tensor. The so-called multiscale learned representation is obtained based on an efficient quadtree decomposition of the trained tensor dictionary. Experimental results on numerical simulations and real MSIs demonstrate that multiscale tensor dictionary gets better indexes in terms of PSNR and SSIM compared with single-scale tensor dictionary and other related competing methods. At the same time, from the perspective of visual quality, our method restores more image details than other methods.

AB  - Image fusion is extensively used in remote sensing to combine multiple images into a more informative single image, which is more suitable for human and machine perception. The purpose of image fusion algorithms is to achieve a single image with high spatial resolution and high spectral resolution. The major challenges faced by existing algorithms are of output image quality in terms of colour distortion and blurring. This paper models the spatio-spectral image fusion as a problem of non-linear dimensionality reduction. The aim is to define each point of fused image as a linear combination of its neighbours in multi spectral image and the corresponding pixel values from down scaled panchromatic image. The assumption here is that the spectral behaviour of fused image is similar to that of multispectral image. The performance of the model is compared with existing state of the art methods for same-sensor dataset.

AB  - The carrier-free ultra-wideband (UWB) sensor characterizes high distance resolution and high interference immunity. It is not easily affected by weather and lighting conditions, and its received echoes contain detailed structural information of the target. In this paper, we propose a terrain recognition framework based on the carrier-free UWB sensor. For the purpose of extracting noise-robustness features, a deep network named stacked denoising autoencoder (SDAE) is developed. Given that the convolutional neural network (CNN) is insensitive to translation to some extent, we combine several CNNs as middle structures of the proposed model. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can effectively learn essential representation and improve classification accuracy in the presence of low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), making it very suitable for use in a classification scheme.

AB  - This publication presents an unsupervised network impedance estimation method for AC microgrid electrical networks using only voltage and current synchrophasor measurements. The proposed method combines the use of two techniques: the Kron reduction and a novel common mode elimination technique to improve estimation robustness to measurement noise. We motivate Kron reduction as an instrument for addressing the rank-deficiency of electrical network voltage measurement data. The Kron reduced model can be used in optimal power flow and other centralized and decentralized control algorithms. The proposed common mode elimination technique improves the robustness of the impedance estimate to sensor noise by improving the eigenstructure of the voltage measurement data matrix, without discarding any useful information. We present results demonstrating improved admittance matrix estimation accuracy on realistic data over a range of signal to noise (SNR) ratios. The proposed method is data-driven and will update the network impedance estimate based on sensor measurements alone, without any external input, making it is well suited for time-varying microgrid applications.

AB  - Mesh denoising is crucial for improving the quality of meshes required by scanning devices. The main challenge is to maximally preserve geometric features while removing different kinds of noise. In this paper, we propose a novel normal filtering model that incorporates a high order  $\ell_{p}$  regularization term and an  $\ell_{1}$  fidelity term. Then, vertex positions of the mesh can be reconstructed according to the filtered face normals. Thanking to the proposed  $\ell_{p}$ - $\ell_{1}$  normal filtering model, our method has crucial advantage in preserving geometric features and simultaneously is robust against different kinds of noise. Numerically, we develop an efficient algorithm based on iteratively reweighted  $\ell_{1}$  minimization and augmented Lagrangian method to solve the problem. We testify effectiveness of our mesh denoising method on synthetic meshes and a broad variety of scanning data produced by the laser scanner and Kinect sensors. We compare our method to state-of-the-art methods and demonstrate the superiority of our method in various cases.

AB  - Phasor estimation is crucial for monitoring and control of smart power systems. The classical signal processing method named Prony has been used for estimating the parameters of measured signals such as frequency, damping factor and phasor. To reduce the impact of noise on the parameters estimated by Prony, multi-channel Prony has been previously explored and presented in the literature. The basic approach for multi-channel Prony is a generalized solution, in which new rows are added to matrices for every channel. Since the generalized multi -channel Prony is time-consuming, a new method based on recursive solution is proposed in this paper to make it suitable for real-time application. Here, several channels of one Phasor Measurement Unit (PMU) are used to estimate the phasor of current/voltage in a recursive pattern, in which the phasor is computed recursively over time based on previously calculated estimates and new measurements. The proposed method is compared with three other solutions for multi-channel Prony: a) data fusion which is based on the Kalman filter concept, b) an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), and c) a consensus update approach which is based on an iterative procedure. Simulation results demonstrate the ability of the proposed method for real-time phasor estimation, both in terms of maintaining the accuracy and reducing computation time.

AB  - Activity recognition is important for taking care of patients and old men especially in e-Health. The activity recognition system without carrying any wearable devices is widely used in our daily life. Current methods employing uneconomical equipment or even dedicated devices lead to cost-inefficiency for large-scale deployments. This paper introduces R&P, a device-free activity recognition system only using cheap radio frequency identification devices (RFID) tags. Based on the analysis of RFID signals, we extract received signal strength fingerprints and phase fingerprints for each activity and synthesize these two kinds of fingerprints to accurately recognize activities. Moreover, we also modify the dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithm and propose T-DTW method to improve the recognition efficiency. We use commercial passive RFID hardware and verify R&Pin three different environments with different targets and six activities. The results demonstrate that our solution can recognize activities with an average accuracy of 87.9%.

AB  - Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) radars provide various advantages as compared to conventional radars. Among these advantages, improved angular diversity feature is being explored for future fully autonomous vehicles. Improved angular diversity requires use of orthogonal waveforms at transmit as well as receive sides. This orthogonality between waveforms is critical as the cross-correlation between signals can inhibit the detection of weaker targets due to sidelobes of stronger targets. This paper investigates the Reiterative Minimum Mean Squared Error (RMMSE) mismatch filter design for range sidelobes reduction for a Slow-Time Phase-Coded (ST-PC) Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) MIMO radar. Initially, the performance degradation of RMMSE filter is analyzed for improperly decoded received pulses. It is then shown mathematically that proper decoding of received pulses requires phase compensation related to any phase distortions caused due to doppler and spatial locations of targets. To cater for these phase distortions, it is proposed to re-adjust the traditional order of operations in radar signal processing to doppler, angle and range. Additionally, it is also proposed to incorporate sidelobes decoherence for further suppression of sidelobes. This is achieved by modification of the structured covariance matrix of baseline single-input RMMSE mismatch filter. The modified structured covariance matrix is proposed to include the range estimates corresponding to each transmitter. These proposed modifications provide additional sidelobes suppression while it also provides additional fidelity for target peaks. The proposed approach is demonstrated through simulations as well as field experiments. Superior performance in terms of range sidelobes suppression is observed when compared with baseline RMMSE and traditional Hanning windowed range response.

AB  - Compressive sensing (CS) techniques have been proposed for wideband spectrum sensing applications to achieve sub-Nyquist-rate sampling. The complexity of CS recovery algorithm and the detection performance against noise are two of the main challenges of the implementation of compressive spectrum sensing (CSS). Greedy algorithms have been of particular interest in CSS due to low complexity. We firstly propose a novel spectrum sparsity estimation scheme directly from sub-Nyquist measurements, with which the computational effort of greedy pursuit algorithms can be saved and recovery performance improved. Besides, the spectrum sparsity estimates also enable hard detection of channel occupancy where threshold adaption for energy detection is avoided. Moreover, with the detected dimension of signal subspace, we propose to implement joint-block-sparse multiple-measurement-vector (MMV) model of CSS whose dimension can be reduced to minimum and meanwhile a large portion of noise is removed. The proposed MMV model with noise and dimension reduction further improves the detection performance and also keeps the complexity low. Finally, we generalize the hard thresholding pursuit (HTP) algorithm to recover joint-block-sparse signals. In simulations, the detection performance and complexity of the proposed CSS scheme show striking superiority against multiple benchmarking schemes.

AB  - This paper presents a novel integrated measurement system of pitch angle( $\beta $ ), phase angle( $\alpha $ )and speed( ${N}_{P}$ ) based on phonic wheel to solve the problem of limited installation space of multiple sensors for multiple propellers’ synchrophasing noise reduction control in a turboprop aircraft. Using a set of symmetrical helical marker teeth to reflect the change of the pitch angle and as a phase angle reference point  $\alpha _{0}$ , the phonic wheel with novel structure can realize the simultaneous measurement of three parameters. The axial movement of the phonic wheel reflects the pitch angle, and the spacing between the two marker teeth varies with the axial movement. After signal conditioning and rising edge capture, a series of rising edge instants(they are correspond to the arrival time of the teeth) are extracted by microprocessor, and the marker teeth have shorter time intervals than regular teeth. Hence, pitch angle, phase angle and speed can be automatically obtained through microprocessor’s measurement algorithm. Numerical simulation of COMSOL is employed for optimizing the phonic wheel structure. An experimental platform is designed to test the performance of the integrated measurement system. Results demonstrate that the pitch angle error varies linearly with axial displacement due to the influence of marker teeth, and after linear compensation of  $\beta $  using the interpolation table, the measurement precision of  $\beta $ ,  $\alpha $  and  ${N}_{P}$  can meet the control requirements of turboprop engine.

AB  - Over-the-air computation (AirComp) is a promising multiple-access scheme that seamlessly integrates the computation and communication by leveraging the waveform superposition properly of a multiple access channel. To unleash the full potential of AirComp, in this paper, we present a double-RIS assisted multiple-input multiple-output AirComp system, where two RISs are deployed to extend the effective coverage area and enhance the channel quality of randomly distributed sensors. We consider the cooperative passive beamforming design at RISs to further improve the performance. Our objective is to minimize the mean-squared error of AirComp by jointly optimizing the receive beamforming, denoising factor, transmit power control, cooperative passive beamforming design. The formulated problem is challenging to be optimally solved due to the coupled cooperative passive beamforming and transceiver variables. To this end, we propose an efficient algorithm based on the block coordinate descent method and semidefinite relaxation to obtain the receive beamforming at the AP and the cooperative passive beamforming at RISs after deriving the closed-form solutions for denoising factor and transmit power control. The numerical results validate that the double-RIS assisted AirComp system achieves a better performance compared to the single-RIS baseline in various system settings.

AB  - In recent years, with the rise of artificial intelligence, the research in the field of pattern recognition is developing rapidly. Its supporting algorithms mainly include neural network and support vector machine (SVM), which are widely used in various fields such as industrial detection, aviation, medical treatment, finance, internet and so on. On the one hand, the effect of pattern recognition is related to the selection and optimization of the algorithm, on the other hand, it is closely related to the noise reduction methods to improve the signal quality, the feature extraction and feature selection in feature engineering. Mel frequency cepstrum coefficient (MFCC) is widely used in the field of speech recognition, and has achieved good recognition effect for low-frequency speech signal pattern recognition, but its pattern recognition in ultrasonic field is rarely studied. In this paper, a method of extracting MFCC in ultrasonic frequency range and applying it to SVM pattern recognition and fault prediction is proposed. In the experimental verification stage, GIS-PD model is used to collect data of acoustic emission (AE) signal induced by partial discharge (PD) of gas insulated switchgear (GIS), and MFCC eigenvalues are extracted in the ultrasonic frequency range of 20-200 kHz. Finally, MFCC and optimized selected time-domain and frequency-domain eigenvalues are used for SVM pattern recognition to monitor and warn the running state of GIS equipment. Based on the comprehensive scheme proposed in this study, the overall accuracy rate is improved to ninety percent after fusion of MFCC eigenvalues, which is improved by 22.5 percent compared with only using time-frequency domain eigenvalues. At present, the research on MFCC extraction in the ultrasonic frequency range of 20-200 kHz and its application in SVM pattern recognition has not been reported. This study will promote the research of MFCC in the field of ultrasonic detection, and provide reference for the research in related fields.

AB  - Recently, over-the-air computation (AirComp) has emerged as an efficient solution for access points (APs) to aggregate distributed data from many edge devices (e.g., sensors) by exploiting the waveform superposition property of multiple access (uplink) channels. While prior work focuses on the single-cell setting where inter-cell interference is absent, this article considers a multi-cell AirComp network limited by such interference and investigates the optimal policies for controlling devices' transmit power to minimize the mean squared errors (MSEs) in aggregated signals received at different APs. First, we consider the scenario of centralized multi-cell power control. To quantify the fundamental AirComp performance tradeoff among different cells, we characterize the Pareto boundary of the multi-cell MSE region by minimizing the sum MSE subject to a set of constraints on individual MSEs. Though the sum-MSE minimization problem is non-convex and its direct solution intractable, we show that this problem can be optimally solved via equivalently solving a sequence of convex second-order cone program (SOCP) feasibility problems together with a bisection search. This results in an efficient algorithm for computing the optimal centralized multi-cell power control, which optimally balances the interference-and-noise-induced errors and the signal misalignment errors unique for AirComp. Next, we consider the other scenario of distributed power control, e.g., when there lacks a centralized controller. In this scenario, we introduce a set of interference temperature (IT) constraints, each of which constrains the maximum total inter-cell interference power between a specific pair of cells. Accordingly, each AP only needs to individually control the power of its associated devices for single-cell MSE minimization, but subject to a set of IT constraints on their interference to neighboring cells. By optimizing the IT levels, the distributed power control is shown to provide an alternative method for characterizing the same multi-cell MSE Pareto boundary as the centralized counterpart. Building on this result, we further propose an efficient algorithm for different APs to cooperate in iteratively updating the IT levels to achieve a Pareto-optimal MSE tuple, by pairwise information exchange. Last, simulation results demonstrate that cooperative power control using the proposed algorithms can substantially reduce the sum MSE of AirComp networks compared with the conventional single-cell approaches.

AB  - Using continuous-wave technology to replace conventional pulse mode, frequency-modulation continuous-wave (FMCW) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) reduces the sensor peak transmission power, and hence minimizes the weight and cost of system, which makes it is very suitably for the short-range airborne SAR imaging. In this paper, we introduce the sparse imaging method to the real airborne FMCW SAR data processing to obtain high-resolution image of surveillance region. In addition, considering the platform motion error in data collection, motion compensation is also integrated into the algorithm implementation to guarantee the exact focus of raw data. Compared with matched filtering (MF) based algorithms, sparse imaging method can improve the image performance efficiently, such as sidelobes reduction, noise suppression, and has down-sampled data based imaging ability for sparse scene. Experimental results via actual airborne data verify the effectiveness of the sparse imaging method in FMCW SAR data processing.

AB  - Resistive bridge sensors are used in many application areas to measure changes in physical parameters. To amplify the resistive changes from sensing elements with high precision, various offset contributors in the resistive bridge and amplifiers should be minimized. This study proposes a low-noise resistive bridge sensor analog front-end (AFE) using a chopper-stabilized multipath current feedback instrumentation amplifier (CFIA) and an automatic offset cancellation loop. The proposed circuit exploits a multipath chopper-stabilized architecture for obtaining low noise performance and wide bandwidth characteristics. This circuit can minimize the offsets in the bridge and the high frequency and low frequency amplifiers, while achieving high precision resistive signal acquisition. The high frequency path of the multipath amplifier uses the CFIA topology with class-AB output stage. The offset in the high frequency path is stabilized by the low frequency path amplifier with a high gain and low noise chopper amplifier. The up-modulated offset in the low frequency chopper amplifier path is reduced by the AC-coupled ripple reduction loop (RRL). An automatic offset calibration loop (AOCL) circuit was designed to calibrate the offset due to the bridge mismatch. The AOCL reduces the bridge offset using a successive approximation register (SAR)-based binary-search algorithm. The gain of the proposed circuit is adjustable from 15.56 dB to 44.14 dB. The AFE is implemented in a  $0.18~ \boldsymbol {\mu } \text{m}$  CMOS process and draws  $123~ \boldsymbol {\mu } \text{A}$  current from a 3.3 V supply. The input referred noise and noise efficiency factor (NEF) are 14.6 nV/  $\boldsymbol {\surd } $ Hz and 6.1, respectively.

AB  - A 3D point cloud is often synthesized from depth measurements collected by sensors at different viewpoints. The acquired measurements are typically both coarse in precision and corrupted by noise. To improve quality, previous works denoise a synthesized 3D point cloud a posteriori, after projecting the imperfect depth data onto the 3D space. Instead, we enhance depth measurements on the sensed images a priori, exploiting inherent 3D geometric correlation across views, before synthesizing a 3D point cloud from the improved measurements. By enhancing closer to the actual sensing process, we benefit from optimization targeting specifically the depth image formation model, before subsequent processing steps that can further obscure measurement errors. Mathematically, for each pixel row in a pair of rectified viewpoint depth images, we first construct a graph reflecting inter-pixel similarities via metric learning using data in previous enhanced rows. To optimize left and right viewpoint images simultaneously, we write a non-linear mapping function from left pixel row to the right based on 3D geometry relations. We formulate a MAP optimization problem, which, after suitable linear approximations, results in an unconstrained convex and differentiable objective, solvable using fast gradient method (FGM). Experimental results show that our method noticeably outperforms recent denoising algorithms that enhance after 3D point clouds are synthesized.

AB  - Compressive spectral imaging (CSI) is a framework that captures coded-and-multiplexed low-dimensional projections of spectral data-cubes. In general, the sensing process in many CSI architectures is described using binary matrices, so-called sensing/projection matrices, whose elements can be either random or designed. However, some characteristics of the spectral data, such as the ℓ2-norm or the second moment statistics, can be lost when this dimensionality reduction is performed. Similarly, principal component analysis (PCA) is a data dimensionality reduction technique that minimizes the least-squared error between the spectral data and its low-dimensional projection, but preserving its structure or variance. Thus, PCA can be used to guide the CSI acquisition process by designing the binary sensing matrix. Nonetheless, PCA requires to know the spectral image a-priori, and also, its associated projection matrix is not binary, as required by CSI optical architectures. Therefore, in this paper, an algorithm to design CSI sensing matrices by exploiting the structure-preserving property of the PCA projection is proposed. First, a set of compressive measurements obtained with random sensing matrices is used to rapidly estimate the covariance matrix associated with the spectral data. Then, a new sensing matrix is designed by solving a non-convex optimization problem that finds a set of binary vectors that approximate the principal components of the covariance matrix, thus maximizing the explanation of the data variance. Experimental results show an improvement of up to 3 dB in image reconstruction quality, in terms of the peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR), when the binary PCA-based sensing matrices are used and compared with conventional random sensing matrices and state-of-art designed matrices based on PCA.

AB  - Over-the-air computation (AirComp) has emerged as a promising technique in future intelligent wireless networks, which enables swift functional computation among distributed wireless devices (WDs) by exploiting the superposition property of wireless channels. This paper studies a new <i>hierarchical</i> AirComp network over a large area, in which a set of intermediate relays are exploited to facilitate the massive data aggregation from a large number of WDs. Under this setup, we present a two-phase amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying protocol. In the first phase, the WDs simultaneously send their data to the relays, while in the second phase, the relays amplify the respectively received signals and concurrently forward them to the fusion center (FC) for aggregation. Our objective is to minimize the computational mean squared error (MSE) at the FC, by jointly optimizing the transmit coefficients of the WDs, the AF coefficients of the relays, and the de-noising factor of the FC, subject to their individual transmit power constraints. First, we consider the centralized design with global channel state information (CSI), in which the inter-relay signals can be exploited beneficially for data aggregation. In this case, we develop an alternating-optimization-based algorithm to obtain a high-quality solution to the computational MSE minimization problem. The obtained solution shows that the phase of the transmit coefficient at each WD is opposite to that of the WD-relay-FC channel to ensure the signal phase alignment at the FC, and the transmit power of each WD/relay follows a regularized composite-channel-inversion structure to strike a balance between minimizing the signal-magnitude-misalignment-induced error and the noise-induced error. Next, to reduce the signaling overhead caused by the centralized design, we consider an alternative decentralized design with partial CSI, in which the relays and the FC make their own decisions by only requiring the channel power gain information across different relays. In this case, the relays and FC need to treat the inter-relay signals as harmful interference or noise. Accordingly, we optimize the transmit coefficients of the WDs associated with each relay, and the relay AF coefficients (together with the FC de-noising factor) in an iterative manner, which can be implemented efficiently in a decentralized way. Finally, numerical results show the fast convergence of the proposed centralized and decentralized designs. It is also shown that both designs achieve significant MSE performance gains over benchmark schemes without the joint optimization.

AB  - Internet of Underwater things (IoUT) is growing into one of the most important research interests since the last few decades. The primary objective of IoUT is to develop a worldwide network of smart underwater-interconnected objects. It has wide-ranging aquatic applications, including surveillance, pollution reduction, monitoring offshore oil and gas pipelines, disaster prevention, and navigation assistance, making it as important as a terrestrial communication system. The underwater communication channel poses unique acoustic communication challenges that suffer from long propagation delay, low bandwidth, multipath, and fading. IoUT significantly differs from the conventional Internet of Things (IoT) due to disparate environmental conditions under the ocean that require re-designing the underwater communication channel model. In addition to the challenges mentioned above, end-to-end delay and efficient energy utilization are also of great concern. Therefore, in this research paper, diverse attributes of underwater acoustic communication, including the speed of sound, transmission loss, absorption, and ambient noise, are analyzed to design a channel model for underwater communication. These environmental conditions also make underwater acoustic channels highly variable, so efficient resources, including bandwidth and power, are required. Adaptive modulation is proposed to make the communications system efficient by considering the distance between nodes and the signal-to-noise ratio as channel state information. The proposed channel model critically analyzed the CSI factors, results show efficient bandwidth utilization and appropriate power consumption for the well-suited route. The proposed research also aims to reduce end-to-end propagation delay by considering vertical angle-based shortest path (efficient route) in the Multilevel rotating priority MRP-routing algorithm.

AB  - Coded aperture is a promising approach for capturing the 4-D light field (LF), in which the 4-D data are compressively modulated into 2-D coded measurements that are further decoded by reconstruction algorithms. The bottleneck lies in the reconstruction algorithms, resulting in rather limited reconstruction quality. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel learning-based framework for the reconstruction of high-quality LFs from acquisitions via learned coded apertures. The proposed method incorporates the measurement observation into the deep learning framework elegantly to avoid relying entirely on data-driven priors for LF reconstruction. Specifically, we first formulate the compressive LF reconstruction as an inverse problem with an implicit regularization term. Then, we construct the regularization term with a deep efficient spatial-angular separable convolutional sub-network in the form of local and global residual learning to comprehensively explore the signal distribution free from the limited representation ability and inefficiency of deterministic mathematical modeling. Furthermore, we extend this pipeline to LF denoising and spatial super-resolution, which could be considered as variants of coded aperture imaging equipped with different degradation matrices. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform state-of-the-art approaches to a significant extent both quantitatively and qualitatively, i.e., the reconstructed LFs not only achieve much higher PSNR/SSIM but also preserve the LF parallax structure better on both real and synthetic LF benchmarks. The code will be publicly available at https://github.com/MantangGuo/DRLF.

We consider sensor noise filtration of Distance Measuring Equipment and VHF omnidirectional Range as an initial data processing and noise reduction at trajectory data processing. Multiple changes of navigational aids in pairs lead to pure noise filtration of distances and angles measurements. Noise filtration at top level provides better performance of trajectory data processing in comparison with sensor data filtration.

AB  - In the field of nondestructive testing (NDT) of wire rope, magnetic flux leakage (MFL) detection is the most widely used method. The traditional single-dimensional MFL detection system has the disadvantages of large volume, heavy weight, low sensitivity and low recognition rate. In order to overcome these problems, this paper designed the three-dimensional MFL acquisition system based on unsaturated magnetic excitation using the tunnel magnetoresistive (TMR) elements and proposed the three-dimensional MFL detection method. We mapped the three-dimensional MFL signals after noise reduction to Red-Green-Blue (RGB) space for color imaging. Then, the localization and segmentation algorithms were used to crop color images of broken wire defects. Finally, the color moment eigenvalues of color images of six types broken wire defects were extracted as the input of the back propagation (BP) neural network to quantitatively identify the broken wires. From the experimental results of the quantitative identification of broken wire defects, it can be seen that it is feasible to use the color images of the three-dimensional MFL signals to quantitatively identify the broken wire defects. Moreover, the three-dimensional MFL color imaging can effectively improve the recognition rate of broken wires.

AB  - We present an algorithm for real-time video denoising on mobile platforms. Based on Gaussian-Laplacian pyramid decomposition, our solution's main contributions are fast alignment and a new interpolation function that fuses noisy frames into a denoised result. The interpolation function is adaptive to local and global properties of the input frame, robust to motion alignment errors, and can be computed efficiently. We show that the proposed algorithm has comparable quality to offline high-quality video denoising methods, but is orders of magnitude faster. On a modern mobile platform, our work takes less than 20ms to process one HD frame, and it achieves the highest score on a public benchmark.

AB  - Recently, the issue of food authentication has gained attention, especially halal authentication, because of cases of pork adulteration in beef. Many studies have developed rapid detection for adulterated meat. However, these studies are not yet practical and economical methods and instruments and a faster analysis process. In this context, this paper proposes the Optimized Electronic Nose System (OENS) for more accurately detecting pork adulteration in beef. OENS has advantages such as proper noise filtering, an optimized sensor array, and optimized support vector machine (SVM) parameters. Noise filtering is carried out by cross-validation with different mother wavelets, i.e., Haar, dmey, coiflet, symlet, and Daubechies. The sensor array was optimized by dimension reduction using principal component analysis (PCA). An algorithm is proposed for the optimization of the SVM parameters. An experiment was conducted by analyzing seven classes of meat, comprising seven different mixtures of beef and pork. The first and seventh classes were 100% beef and 100% pork, respectively, while the second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth classes contained 10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 90% of beef in a sample of 100 grams, respectively. Sample testing was carried out for 15 minutes for each sample. The classification test results to detect beef and pork had an accuracy of 98.10% using the optimized support vector machine. Thus, OENS has a favorable performance to detect pork adulteration in beef for halal authentication.

AB  - The demand for cable diagnostics and monitoring techniques has increased significantly in recent decades. Various diagnostic tests such as partial discharge, dielectric loss, and elongation-at-break tests are available in real-world applications. Among the cable diagnostic methods, reflectometry can be used to detect the location of a fault according to the reflected signal at the impedance-discontinuity point. Because it is a nondestructive method and can be applied regardless of the cable type, reflectometry is commonly used for monitoring real-world applications. Time-frequency domain reflectometry, an improved type of reflectometry, is more accurate than conventional reflectometry and employs time-frequency localized signals that are robust to noise. To compensate for the errors occurring in the time-frequency domain reflectometry, several algorithms have been reviewed. In the past, because the signal of time-frequency domain reflectometry contains both time and frequency information, a high-specification signal generator and measurement sensors were required, which made practical application of the method difficult. However, with recent developments in instrumentation and sensing technology, reduction in the instrumentation size and cost facilitates the use of time-frequency domain reflectometry in various industrial applications, e.g., control and instrumentation cables in nuclear power plants, superconducting cables, and submarine cables. This work reviews the use of time-frequency domain reflectometry for cable diagnostics and monitoring in real-world applications. The purpose and results of the experiments on industrial applications are introduced and analyzed. This study also suggests directions for further research to make time-frequency domain reflectometry a diagnostic standard.

AB  - In this paper, we consider the current status and technical issues involved in the use of optical camera communication (OCC)/visible light communication (VLC) technologies in vehicular communication systems. Hybrid spatial phase-shift keying was introduced in IEEE 802.15.7-2018 as the standard hybrid modulation scheme for vehicular OCC/VLC systems. We herein propose a functional communication system architecture for vehicular systems based on this hybrid waveform, and we also present state-of-the-art research work on an artificial intelligence (AI)-based vehicular OCC system. Every AI module within the proposed system architecture is discussed in detail. Finally, our experimental procedures and results are analyzed to evaluate the performance of the proposed system over a complex channel model in a vehicular environment. We effectively employed the popular You Only Look Once version 2 object detection algorithm for real-time region-of-interest tracking in city driving (at a vehicular velocity of around 30 km/h and highway night driving (at a vehicular velocity of > 60 km/h) scenarios. Moreover, our novel neural-network-based decoder and AI-based error correction proved effective in improving the data decoding accuracy, resulting in a best-case reduction of 2.2 and 9.0 dB, respectively, in the signal-to-noise ratio needed to achieve the desired bit error rate of 10-4 in a vehicular OCC/VLC system.

The article describes the implementation of non-electric quantities (indoor CO2 concentration, indoor temperature, indoor relative humidity) measurement in five rooms of a family home (living room, kitchen, children’s room, bathroom, bedroom) using Loxone technology sensors. The IBM IoT (Internet Of Things) was used for storing and subsequent processing of the measured values within the time interval of December 22, 2018, to December 31, 2018. The devised method used radial basis function (artificial neural networks (ANN)) mathematical method (implementation in Python environment) to perform accurate predictions. For further increase of the accuracy and reduction of prediction noise from the obtained course of the predicted signal, multiple variations of the LMS adaptive filter algorithm (Sign, Sign-Sign, Sign-Regressor) were used (implemented in the MATLAB SW tool). The accuracy of the newly proposed CO2 concentration prediction method exceeds 95% in the selected experiments.

AB  - The goal of this work is to provide a brief review on the image compression algorithms in the wireless capsule endoscopy, which is efficient and simple. This paper also covers the review on each stage of the image compression algorithms and its efficiency. At the latter part of this paper, an ideal algorithm for the image compression with high compression ratio and good image reconstruction quality. The main complication associated with the wireless endoscopy system is the reduction in area and consumed power while preserving the acceptable reconstruction of video with high quality. Most of the existing algorithms are based on DCT algorithms which require more buffer space; thereby it increases the large area and large power for the computation. In this paper, the different data compressor based on DCT is presented. The ideal scheme is based on the subsampling of data. Special features and characteristics of endoscopic images are considered in the stage of algorithm development. The algorithm includes the compression technique differential pulse coded modulation (DPCM) which is lossless followed by simple, efficient and variable length encoding called Golomb-Rice coding. The proposed ideal image compressor is compatible with any image sensors which are low power and commercially available that outputs the pixels of the images in a raster scan manner. It will evict the need of the memory buffer and temporary storage needed in the transform based coding methods. Additional compression acquired by the introduction of the corner clipping algorithm to remove the distorted corners present in the endoscopic images. Compared to other algorithms aims at wireless capsule endoscopy, the proposed ideal algorithm is highly efficient with a high compression ratio as well as very high reconstruction peak signal-to-noise ratio.

AB  - Because of the low-light shooting environment, the camera sensor will loss huge details and fuzzy edge. A deep low-light residual convolutional network (LRCNN) is proposed in this paper, which utilizes the sparse coding feature to get the true signal and adaptively adjusts the image exposure in the low-light state. The residual connections in LRCNN help us preserve more potential detail information in the original picture and accelerate the training speed of the network. Many existing image enhancement algorithms only are able to address one aspect of image problems. We designed a neural network system which could deal with many image processing problems at the same time. The experimental results show that our neural network system well optimizes the images that affected by darkness and noise. It also avoids an artificial appearance in generating the image patches.

AB  - Very high requirement of co-registration accuracy better than 0.001 pixels for Sentinel-1 TOPS (Terrain Observation by Progressive Scan) mode presents a great challenge for application of SAR (synthetic aperture radar) interferometry in Earth Observation. The state-of-the-art techniques have demonstrated that the low coherence scenarios and abrupt loss of coherence between two arbitrary acquisitions are main sources of error to degrade the performance of TOPS time-series co-registration. In this paper, we present a modification to overcome both limitations through the coherence enhancement. The motive behind this is to improve the quality of observations before co-registration and meanwhile avoiding the coherence loss caused by fast decorrelation. To this end, principal components analysis based spatio-temporal filtering is first used to remove the artifacts in burst interferograms over strong noise areas. Rather than heuristically choosing a sub-set of interferograms as a small baseline technique does, we use Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm under graph theory framework to maximize the coherence of a sub-set interferograms. The performance of presented method against the state-of-the-art techniques is fully evaluated by synthetic data and a Sentinel-1A stack over a low coherence scene in Indonesia. Comprehensive comparisons demonstrate 9%-17% uncertainty reduction of time-series co-registration when applying our method.

AB  - This correspondence paper studies a network integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system that unifies the interference channel for communication and distributed radar sensing. In this system, a set of distributed ISAC transmitters send individual messages to their respective communication users (CUs), and at the same time cooperate with multiple sensing receivers to estimate the location of one target. We exploit the coordinated power control among ISAC transmitters to minimize their total transmit power while ensuring the minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraints at individual CUs and the maximum Cram&#x00E9;r-Rao lower bound (CRLB) requirement for target location estimation. Although the formulated coordinated power control problem is non-convex and difficult to solve in general, we propose two efficient algorithms to obtain high-quality solutions based on the semi-definite relaxation (SDR) and CRLB approximation, respectively. Numerical results show that the proposed designs achieve substantial performance gains in terms of power reduction, as compared to the benchmark with a heuristic separate communication-sensing design.

AB  - The powerful performance of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in image-to-image translation has been well demonstrated in recent years. However, most methods are focused on completing an isolated image translation task. With the complex scenes in optical images and high-frequency speckle noise in SAR images, the quality of generated images is often unsatisfactory. In this paper, a feature-guided method for SAR-to-optical image translation is proposed to better take the unique attributes of images into account. Specifically, in view of the diversity of structure features and texture features, VGG-19 network is used as the feature extractor in the task of cross-modal image translation. To ensure the acquisition of multilayer features in the process of image generation, feature matching is carried out on different layers. Loss function based on Discrete Cosine Transform is designed to filter out the high-frequency noise. The generated images show better performance in feature preservation and noise reduction, and achieve higher Image Quality Assessment scores compared with images generated by some famous methods. The superiority of our algorithm is also demonstrated by being applied to different networks.

AB  - Traditional observation-to-track data association algorithms, such as Bayesian methods, suffer from exponential growth in computational complexity with increase in a number of targets, especially in dense environments with low signal-to-noise ratio. This paper utilizes tensor decomposition, a commonly used technique to tackle “curse of dimensionality” in high dimensional applications, to reduce the aforementioned complexity in data association problems. The Joint Probabilistic Data Association (JPDA) is a pseudo-Bayesian sub-optimal filter that lends itself to be modified within the framework of incremental tensor decomposition to reduce its computational burden resulting from computing the probabilities of noncompeting join association events or “feasible events”. The number of feasible events is reduced by a using a “core” tensor instead of the complete set of measurements received at a specified instance in time. Furthermore, to reduce computational overhead while performing decomposition, many such measurements are combined into “batches”. The “core” tensor is obtained from Dynamic Tensor Analysis (DTA). This reduction in computational burden from the new tensor based JPDA method when compared to the traditional JPDA method is demonstrated via a numerical example of a Space Situational Awareness Problem (SSA).

AB  - In order to obtain the respiratory condition unobtrusively and comfortably, a non-contact method based on the commercial depth camera Realsense SR300 was proposed to extract respiratory information from depth data. In this paper, a respiratory region detecting algorithm which is mainly based on the morphological method was proposed to obtain the region of interest (ROI) with the depth images. The proposed algorithm contains four steps: body edge extraction, noise reduction, “image skeleton” extraction, and respiratory region estimation. As a result, the respiratory waveform can be derived from the depth data in the ROI. For validation, experiments were carried out to verify the feasibility of obtaining the respiratory information with this approach. In consideration of different application scenarios, 20 kinds of conditions were designed and applied for the experiments. The respiratory rate extracted from the depth waveform can be calculated, and the accuracy achieved was 95.20% for all data while utilizing polysomnography thorax effort signal as gold standard. Through the Bland–Altman analysis, it represented that the proposed system had a good agreement ( $r^{2} = 0.88$ ) with the gold standard. In addition, the performances of the system in the 20 different conditions were analyzed by statistics, and the results showed that the system has good adaptability and robustness for different conditions. In conclusion, the proposed algorithm can fit different scenarios, and this paper provides a novel option for extracting the physiological information with depth data.

AB  - For wireless networks in the Internet of Things (IoT), cognitive radio (CR) is a promising way to obtain the available spectrum for objects. Wide-band spectrum sensing plays an important role in building such CR networks of IoT. In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic compressive wide-band spectrum sensing method based on channel energy reconstruction. After a bank of wide-band random filters is employed to measure the channel energy, rather than to recover all the channel energy in the whole spectrum, only the channel energy with a changing occupancy status in consecutive time slots is recovered. Furthermore, it is unnecessary to use reconstruction algorithm unless there are two or more channels changing their occupancy status. Compared to the existing methods, our proposed schemes bear significant improvements in the probability of detection and reduction of probability of false alarms. Simulation results also show its fast speed and robustness to noise.

AB  - Geomagnetic signals are attractive media for indoor localization since they have less noise than RF and don't require additional equipment installation for signal generation. The fingerprinting technique used in geomagnetic field based indoor positioning systems (IPS) estimates the position by matching the magnetic vector sampled from the current location with the magnetic vectors recorded in the magnetic field map. However, since the magnetic field is represented by a 3-dimensional vector, the values of a magnetic vector may change depending on the user's orientation or the grip position. Thus, the sampled magnetic vector may have different values from the vector values stored in the magnetic field map depending on the sensor's orientation. This may substantially lower the positioning accuracy. To avoid this problem, the existing studies use only the magnitude of a magnetic vector, but this reduces the uniqueness of the fingerprint, which may also degrade the positioning accuracy. In this paper we propose a vector calibration algorithm which can adjust the sampled magnetic vector to the vector of the magnetic field map by using the parametric equation of a circle. This can minimize mismatching with the magnetic field map. To implement this, we need to compute the relative rotation angle from the moving direction of the current user to the moving direction during the field map collection. Since we can measure the moving direction by using the gyroscope and accelerometer, we can compute this relative rotation angle dynamically. To evaluate our vector calibration algorithm, we compare the value mismatches with and without vector calibration for 6 random-walk paths in our campus testbed of 2470 square meters. Our results show that with the calibration, we can decrease the difference between the sampled magnetic vector and the magnetic field map vectors from 17.61$\mu$T to 2.38 $\mu$T in x dimension, from 17.24$\mu$T to 2.59 $\mu$T in y dimension, and from 6.86 $\mu$T to 2.16 $\mu$T in z dimension on average. This translates to 83% reduction in the map mismatch compared to the numbers without calibration. In addition, we also demonstrate the effectiveness of the calibration by applying the algorithm to our long short-term memory (LSTM)-based IPS.

AB  - With the recent development of earth observation technology, the satellites have obtained the ability to capture city-scale videos, which enable potential applications in intelligent traffic management. Because of the broad field-of-view, the moving vehicles in satellite videos are usually composed of only tens of pixels, making it difficult to differentiate true objects from noise and other distractors. In addition, the edges of tall building tops are often mistakenly detected as moving vehicles because of the effects of motion parallax. This article proposed a terse framework that can effectively suppress false targets, achieving high precision and recall. The study involves three parts: 1) An adaptive filtering method is proposed to reduce noise, thus making the detection algorithm more reliable; 2) Several background subtraction models are tested, and the best one is chosen to produce the preliminary detection results at high recall but low accuracy; 3) A lightweight convolutional neural network (LCNN) is designed and trained on a small collection of samples, and then used to eliminate false targets. The experiments and evaluations demonstrate that our method can largely improve the precision at the expense of a slight reduction of recall.

AB  - Camera calibration and radial distortion correction are the crucial prerequisites for many applications in image big data and computer vision. Many existing works rely on the Manhattan world assumption to estimate the camera parameters automatically; however, they may perform poorly when there was lack of man-made structure in the scene. As walking humans are the common objects in video surveillance, they have also been used for camera self-calibration, but the main challenges include the noise reduction for the estimation of vanishing points, the relaxation of assumptions on unknown camera parameters, and the radial distortion correction. In this paper, we present a novel framework for camera self-calibration and automatic radial distortion correction. Our approach starts with the reliable human body segmentation that is facilitated by robust object tracking. Mean shift clustering and Laplace linear regression are, respectively, introduced in the estimation of the vertical vanishing point and the horizon line. The estimation of distribution algorithm, an evolutionary optimization scheme, is then utilized to optimize the camera parameters and the distortion coefficients, in which all the unknowns in camera projection can be fine-tuned simultaneously. Experiments on the three public benchmarks and our own captured dataset demonstrate the robustness of the proposed method. The superiority of this algorithm is also verified by the capability of reliably converting 2D object tracking into 3D space.

AB  - Hyperspectral images (HSIs) have fine spectral information, and rich spatial information, of which the feature quality is one of the key factors that affect the classification performance. Therefore, how to extract essential features, and eliminate redundant features from hyperspectral data are the main research focus of this article. Here, we propose a spectral-spatial feature extraction method based on ensemble empirical mode decomposition for HSI classification, which contains several steps as follows: First, the dimension reduction for HSI is performed by using the principal component analysis method. Second, in order to decrease the sensitivity to noise, and extract rough outline features, the adaptive total variation filtering (ATVF) is conducted on the selected principal components. Furthermore, by using the ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) to resolve each spectral band into sequence components, the features of HSIs can be better coalesced into the transform domain. Finally, the first K principal components of the input image, and the outputs of the ATVF, and EEMD are integrated into a stacking system to obtain the final feature image, which is then classified by a pixel-wise classifier. The experimental results of three authentic hyperspectral datasets show that the proposed algorithm obtains a superior classification performance compared with other methods.

AB  - Microbarometers deployed to measure atmospheric infrasound are often connected to, or housed within, a wind noise reduction system (WNRS). At infrasound arrays of the International Monitoring System (IMS), being deployed as part of Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty verification measures, the WNRS typically comprises an 18 m diameter pipe array. Over the past decade an in situ method has been developed to estimate the measurement system (sensor + WNRS) response characteristics, by comparing its recordings with those made on a colocated reference sensor with known response and no WNRS. The method relies upon the identification of time periods for which the reference sensor and measurement system are subject to the same input pressure field. It has proven difficult to reliably identify such time periods at frequencies $\lt 0.1\,$ Hz using recordings at a single location, resulting in a negative bias in estimated measurement system gain values (the ‘dip artefact’) in the 0.02–0.1 Hz passband. The IMS is deploying arrays of microbarometers, and we show that a measure of across-array coherence can be used to identify time periods associated with acoustic signal propagation. Amplitude response estimates, using 1 yr of data from four IMS arrays, indicate that the dip artefact can be removed by retaining for analysis only those time periods that exhibit high across-array coherence. Moreover, our analysis confirms the hypothesis that the dip artefact is associated with time periods during which wind-generated pressure fluctuations dominate, leading to partial suppression of noise with length scales less than the extent of the WNRS. At two arrays within continental forests accurate amplitude responses are estimated across the 0.02–4 Hz passband, as acoustic signals at all frequencies can be identified. At two oceanic island arrays, the low numbers of time windows with above-noise acoustic signal in the 0.02–0.1 Hz passband make reliable response estimation at these frequencies difficult or impossible. It is recommended that the methodology for estimating the response of an infrasound measurement system at an array should incorporate a multichannel coherence measure; data centres may already routinely compute such measures in their signal detection algorithms.

AB  - In a thermal power plant, online measurement of the size distribution of pneumatically conveyed pulverized fuel is essential for the improvement of combustion efficiency and the reduction of pollutant emissions. In this article, an innovative instrumentation system based on acoustic emission (AE) detection and triboelectric sensing is proposed for the on-line continuous measurement of particle size distribution. With a waveguide protruding into the flow, the AE signal is generated from the impacts of particles with the waveguide. The peak voltage of the AE signal is related to the particle size and impact velocity. For the first time, two triboelectric sensor arrays each with three arc-shaped electrodes near to the waveguide are used to measure the impact velocity. Meanwhile, a novel particle sizing algorithm with Gaussian prediction is proposed to reduce the effect of overlapping impacts and environmental noise on the peak distribution. With the known impact velocity measured from the triboelectric sensor arrays and the modified peak distribution, the measurement of particle size distribution is achieved. Experimental tests were conducted on a gas–solids two-phase flow rig to assess the performance of the developed measurement system. Silica sands in three size ranges of 116–750, 61–395, and 10– $246~\mu \text{m}$ , respectively, were used as test particles. The experimental results demonstrate that Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients between the measured and reference size distributions for all test particles are all greater than 0.8, while the discrepancy for each particle size segment is within ±4.8%.

AB  - The SAR image generation from raw data can be seen as a decoding problem of raw data which has been encoded by the SAR sensor, where the coding scheme depends on the sensor and the sensing geometry. Compressed sensing (CS) decoding approaches, implicitly model the forward encoding or sensing process in matrix vector form with a sensing matrix, where the dimensions of this matrix grow proportionally with the product of raw data samples and finally wanted image pixels. Especially when applied to Synthetic Aperture Imaging Processing we then face the necessity of handling extremely large data vectors and even larger sensing matrices. Classical focussing/decoding approaches conceptually invert the system of equations, introducing matched filter concepts making use of pseudoinverses. CS concepts under the assumption of images which are sparse in some basis or in combinations of bases promise a reduction of raw data samples without sacrificing resolution or vice versa an improved resolution or signal to noise ratio if the number of raw data samples is not reduced. Consequently the Cramer Rao Bound assuming sparsity of the image to be reconstructed is governed by the number of non-zero coefficients in its sparse description which under an oracle given knowledge of the sparse support converts the forward sensor model into an even overdetermined system of equations which would allow a smaller Cramer Rao Bound than without sparsity assumption. Basis pursuit approaches to CS decoding employ a constrained l1-minimization for the wanted (sparse) image vector to be reconstructed where the constraining data fidelity term models the SAR sensor's encoding, which requires a burdensome matrix vector multiplication in each iteration step. Hence algorithmic issues in realizing the CS decoding play a crucial and decisive role. This paper presents some new results on recursive l1- minimization by Kalman filtering. We consider the l1-norm as an explicit constraint, formulated as a nonlinear l1- observation of the state to be estimated. Interpreting a sparse vector to be estimated as a state which is observed from erroneous (undersampled) measurements we can address time- and space-variant sparsity, any kind of a priori information and also easily address nonstationary error influences in the measurements available. Rather than estimating the full n-dimensional vector of unknowns, the presented approach works on a nullspace basis and only estimates the nullspace vector of dimension n-m, where m is the dimension of the observation vector. Due to this and depending on m, the computational burden of this nullspace vector estimation approach may be considerably smaller in comparison with Chambolle and Pock's Primal Dual Algorithm or many other algorithm estimating the full n-dimensional vector of unknowns. In fact for mildly undetermined systems of equations the computational complexity of the Nullspace Kalman Filter can beat Chambolle and Pock's primal dual algorithm and approaches the OMP complexity, which depends on the sparsity, whereas it does not for the Nullspace Kalman filter.
