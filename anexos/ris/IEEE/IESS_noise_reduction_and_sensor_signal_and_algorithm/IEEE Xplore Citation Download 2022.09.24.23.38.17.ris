AB  - Inertial measurement data holds an important role in inertial navigation. MEMS Inertial Measurement Units "IMUs" are used for inertial measurement in navigation, but these sensors suffer from a big amount of noise which makes the navigational solution degrade very fast with time. Many papers discuss the benefit of using Wavelet denoising, and some papers discuss the use of other filters such as Savitzky-Golay. The purpose of this paper is to examine the real benefit of using denoising techniques on modern MEMS IMUs and using multiple sources of data on multiple trajectories and scenarios, thus justifying the needed CPU cycles for the denoising task. We performed pure inertial navigation without any GNSS aid. Our results showed that the inertial navigation algorithm itself compensates for the type of noise that is usually removed by denoising techniques, and thus there is no need for any pre-filtering of MEMS IMU data using traditional methods.

AB  - Demosaicking and denoising are key steps in the camera imaging chain for both images and videos. The reconstruction errors during these stages will have undesirable effects on the final result if not handled properly. Demosaicking provokes the spatial and color correlation of noise, which is afterwards enhanced by the processing pipeline. This structured noise generally degrades the image quality and, for dark scenes with low signal to noise ratio, prevents the correct interpretation of the image. When trying to mitigate such structured noise on already processed data, denoising methods attenuate details and texture. We present a video processing chain, consisting of a novel strategy for the removal of noise at the camera sensor and a novel video demosaicking algorithm. In both cases, a spatio-temporal patch-based filter with motion compensation is introduced. The experimental results, including real examples, illustrate the performance of the proposed chain, avoiding the creation of interpolation artefacts and colored spots.

AB  - This paper presents the design and proposal of vehicle identification and classification sensing mechanism using fiber-optic distributed acoustic sensing (DAS). The seismic signatures of strategic-cum-domestic vehicles were made to interact with the embedded optical fibers and the acquired backscattered optical data was processed for feature extraction. The vehicle type was identified through the signal processing using a deep learning approach resulting in a novel and intelligent vehicle identification platform. Data denoising was performed using various time-series mining algorithms with at least 500 epochs to test the model accuracy. This fully automated and end-to-end simulated sensing system used an asymmetric generative adversarial network (GAN) for denoising the time series data resulting in the training and testing accuracy of 73.63% and 69.5% respectively. The model can also be employed to measure the real-time speed and position of the vehicle.

AB  - Separation of heart sound signals from the recorded mixtures has become a hot research topic in the clinical diagnosis of heart diseases. To better understand the current health status of patients, it is of great significance to develop intelligent auscultation methods to improve the effectiveness of hearing and assist clinicians in practice. In this paper, an optimization convolutive blind source separation algorithm utilizing independent vector analysis is proposed for separation of the heart sound mixtures. In the algorithm, a denoising approach is firstly used to reduce the impact of the additive white Gaussian noise. Then, using the short time Fourier transform, the mixing signals in time domain are transmitted into the frequency domain. Afterwards, the unmixng matrix is updated using Newton’s method, and the heart sound sources are reconstructed based on the estimated unmixing matrix. Experimental results show that the algorithm obtains better separation performance than the baseline methods. Especially, it has better superiority in the strong reverberant environment.

AB  - Acquired 3D point cloud data, whether from active sensors directly or from stereo-matching algorithms indirectly, typically contain non-negligible noise. To address the point cloud denoising problem, we propose a local graph-based algorithm. Specifically, given a $k$ -nearest-neighbor graph of the 3D points, we first approximate it with a bipartite graph (independent sets of red and blue nodes) using a KL divergence criterion. For each partite of nodes (say red), we first define surface normal of each red node using 3D coordinates of neighboring blue nodes, so that red node normals n can be written as a linear function of red node coordinates p. We then formulate a convex optimization problem, with a quadratic fidelity term $\Vert \mathbf{p}-\mathbf{q}\Vert_{2}^{2}$ given noisy observed red coordinates q and a graph total variation (GTV) regularization term for surface normals of neighboring red nodes. We minimize the resulting $l_{2}-l_{1}$-norm using alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and proximal gradient descent. The two partites of nodes are alternately optimized until convergence. Experimental results show that compared to state-of-the-art schemes with similar complexity, our proposed algorithm achieves the best overall denoising performance objectively and subjectively.

AB  - It is important to consider the peak-to-average-power ratio (PAPR) metric in discrete time radar waveform design for efficient use of the bounded energy budget. In previous literature, much consideration has been given to both the constant modulus and PAPR constrained waveform designs. However, in this approach, we show a straightforward methodology to design the transmit radar waveform to directly constrain PAPR while also considering prohibited bands for transmission (other users perhaps). Improvement in null-depth is observed for multiple design approaches, possibly enough to enable co-existence for radar and communications. Simulated and experimental results are given to corroborate the theoretical understanding.

AB  - Denoising, smoothing, missing data, and outlier issues that occur in many fields involve finding models for noise and data. However, the models often make assumptions of the noise, such as white noise, Gaussian noise, etc. Numerical methods [wavelets, Fourier transforms, Kalman filter, principal component analysis (PCA), etc.] are available for data conditioning. However, they suffer from inaccuracies. This paper presents a new approach, in which a hybrid physics-based model and deep physics neural network (DPNN) model are used to simultaneously build a data conditioning autoencoder (DPNNAE) based on DPNN for enhancing the signal strength, compared to a conventional autoencoder (AE). It necessitates integration of domain-specific physics-based models with a data-driven approach. A one-dimensional (1D) stochastic Burgers equation is used as a prototype for demonstrating the new algorithm but can be easily applied to other systems. This paper provides a new data conditioning approach that performs denoising, smoothing, data imputation, and outlier removal using DPNN and AE. This approach offers an improved and efficient methodology to arrive at the noise-free data and fills the missing data. During this work, the DPNN was applied to predict noise-free velocity in the unsteady viscous stochastic Burgers equation. The loss function is obtained from the physics models produced from domain insight and measured data. Thus, the deep neural network (DNN) framework integrates physics-based models into its framework. The hybrid DPNN model uses measured data from sensors; both measured data and physics are simultaneously satisfied by the model resulting in noise-free measured data. The conditioned data can be further used to build the DPNNAE model for further conditioning, and the DPNN can be used for filling the missing data. The DPNN method outperformed other common denoising algorithms. The new hybrid modeling data conditioning algorithm developed during this work can be applied to any real-time modeling system with real-time measurements for denoising.

AB  - Several noise reduction algorithms have been proposed for wireless acoustic sensor networks, which consist of spatially distributed nodes that are connected via a wireless link. To decrease the required bandwidth and computational complexity, in this paper we propose two iterative distributed maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimators. In the first scheme, each node sequentially updates its estimate, whereas in the second scheme, all nodes simultaneously update their estimates. Based on simulations in a reverberant room with three nodes, we have compared the noise reduction performance of the proposed distributed MAP estimators with the centralized MAP estimator, where each node has access to all signals, and the local MAP estimator, where each node only has access to its own signals. The simulation results show that the proposed distributed estimators result in a good noise reduction performance, while decreasing the computational complexity compared to the centralized estimator.

AB  - Automotive radar interference imposes big challenges on signal processing algorithms as it raises the noise floor and consequently lowers the detection probability. With limited frequency bands and increasing number of sensors per car, avoidance techniques such as frequency hopping or beamforming quickly become insufficient. Detect-and-repair strategies have been studied intensively for the automotive field, to reconstruct the affected signal samples. However depending on the type of interference, reconstruction of the time domain signals is a highly non-trivial task, which can affect following signal processing modules. In this work an autoencoder based convolutional neural network is proposed to perform image based denoising. Interference mitigation is phrased as a denoising task directly on the range-Doppler spectrum. The neural networks shows significant improvement with respect to signal-to-noise-plus-interference ratio in comparison to other state-of-the-art mitigation techniques, while better preserving phase information of the spectrum compared to other techniques.

AB  - The disconnector operation in the high-voltage substations forms a very fast transient overvoltage (VFTO), which leads to a sudden rise in local grounding potential. Due to double grounding of the secondary cable, the current transformer signal is interfered by the grounding grid potential difference. To study the mechanism of the interference signal, a simulation model based on the electro-magnetic transient program is built and the coupling path of the grounding grid potential difference is analyzed. According to the characteristics of interference signal, an adaptive algorithm is put forward and it mainly consists of three parts, including starting element, decision algorithm, and filtering algorithm. By selecting the appropriate parameters of wavelet transform, the filtering algorithm can discompose and reconstruct signal to remove the interference signal. The simulation results demonstrate that the filtering algorithm can effectively eliminate the interference signal caused by the grounding grid potential difference, with a 91% reduction of the root mean square error and a 135% improvement of the signal-to-noise ratio. Moreover, the accuracy of the measured data is ensured and the reliability of the relay protection is improved.

AB  - In this article, a distributed optical fiber sensing system for large infrastructure temperature monitoring is proposed. To meet the requirements of monitoring networks in terms of measurement accuracy, spatial resolution, and real-time or quasireal-time performance, a quaternion wavelet transform (QWT) image denoising algorithm is proposed to address the original edge node data for the structural monitoring networks of large infrastructures. A distributed Brillouin optical time-domain analysis (BOTDA) sensing system with a 40-km sensing fiber is established. The raw Brillouin gain spectrum (BGS) image is decomposed into one magnitude image and three phase images by QWT. The phase images of the OWT are distributed randomly and disorderly with respect to the noise, while the magnitude image of the quaternion wavelet is greatly affected by the noise. The useful message energy of the magnitude image is concentrated on a small number of coefficients with large amplitude, while the noise mainly corresponds to the coefficients with smaller amplitude. Then, the Bayes shrink threshold method is introduced to filter out noise in the magnitude image. The results indicate that the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the frequency uncertainty have been improved significantly. The accuracy of the retrieved Brillouin frequency shift from denoised BGS images reaches 0.2 MHz, which corresponds to a temperature error of ±0.1 °C. Less than 4 s are required to process a BGS image with 50  $\times $  40 000 pixels by the QWT denoising technique. The uploaded data obtained from 40 M bytes of raw data are reduced to 0.08 M bytes for each measurement. We hope that with technological progress and algorithm optimization, the distributed optical fiber sensing system based on the QWT image denoising algorithm will have an important role in the real-time application of large-scale infrastructure structural health monitoring for the Internet of Things.

We propose an efficient noisy data transmission scheme based on denoising Autoencoder (DAE). In order to train the DAE architecture, a modified random noise introducing (RNI) method is presented. The proposed data transmission scheme is named as DTDA-RNI. Performance evaluation results show that the proposed DTDA-RNI scheme outperforms in terms of a higher reconstruction accuracy, a lower compression rate, and a faster reconstruction speed.

AB  - Recently, the advancements in the field of wireless technologies and micro-electro-mechanical systems lead to the development of potential applications in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). The visual sensors in WSN create a significant impact on computer vision based applications such as pattern recognition and image restoration. generate a massive quantity of multimedia data. Since transmission of images consumes more computational resources, various image compression techniques have been proposed. But, most of the existing image compression techniques are not applicable for sensor nodes due to its limitations on energy, bandwidth, memory, and processing capabilities. In this article, we introduce a highly reliable and low-complexity image compression scheme using neighborhood correlation sequence (NCS) algorithm. The NCS algorithm performs the bit reduction operation and then encoded by a codec (such as PPM, Deflate, and Lempel Ziv Markov chain algorithm.) to further compress the image. The proposed NCS algorithm increases the compression performance and decreases the energy utilization of the sensor nodes with high fidelity. Moreover, it achieved a minimum end to end delay of 1074.46 ms at the average bit rate of 4.40 bpp and peak signal to noise ratio of 48.06 on the applied test images. On comparing with state-of-art methods, the proposed method maintains a better tradeoff between compression efficiency and reconstructed image quality.

AB  - Accurate Burden Surface Profile (BSP) detection is important for the operation of Blast Furnace (BF). The signal-to-noise ratio of radar signals changes greatly during both the charging period of BF and the long maintenance period of the radar device, which increases the difficulty of radar BSP detection. The traditional radar BSP detection method based on signal energy relies on manually selected detection thresholds according to the noise intensity. Hence, the accuracy of the traditional radar BSP detection method is not reliable in the long term. To address this problem, we propose a novel learning-based Key Points estimation (KP-BSP) method to detect the key points of radar reconstructed BSP image, and a new Key Points-based Connected Region Noise Reduction (KP-CRNR) algorithm to remove the noise-affected regions. The prediction deviation at detected key points (at the positions of the mechanical probes) is then used to correct the radar detection results, leading to the improvement of radar detection accuracy. The experimental data were collected from Wuhan Iron Steel Company No.7 BF. The results show that the proposed methods can achieve an average RMSE of 0.0156m, which is improved by more than 50% compared with previous methods. The long-term reliability of the proposed method is also demonstrated in this dataset.

AB  - With the rapid development of eye tracking technology, eye movements have become more and more important in human-computer interaction. Generally, eye movements are classified into fixation, saccade, and smooth pursuit. Since the eye movements are natural and fast, contain important cues for human cognitive state and visual attention, the eye movement behaviors are difficult to detect and classify. In this paper, the novel eye-movement data filtering and eye-movement classification algorithm are proposed. The nonlinear wavelet threshold denoising method was used to smooth the eye-movement data and detect saccades in the presence of smooth pursuit movements, according to different eye-movement behaviors related to the different characteristics of wavelet detail coefficients. Experiments were conducted to compare the eye-movement signal analyzing algorithm based on wavelet with other algorithms. The results showed that the eye-movement data filtering algorithm based on wavelet performed better than the other eye-movement filters. Moreover, the classification algorithm based on wavelet can classify different eye-movement behaviors more accurately. Then, we used an eye tracking technology to record and analyze the user's eye movement during the test, so as to get the user's psychological and cognitive state.

AB  - Knowing the location of a transceiver may enable advanced radio resource management strategies in sensing and communication networks. However, there are many scenarios where users operate in a non-cooperative mode with no localization-dedicated signaling with the network. As a result, conventional timing-based or propagation-model-based localization methods cannot be applied. This paper studies a model-free source localization problem where sensors only measure received signal strengths from a wireless signal source. The only assumption made is that the received signal strength decays homogeneously in all directions from the source. A measure of two-dimensional symmetry is developed via monotonic curve fitting to exploit the hidden symmetry and unimodality of the propagation. Based on this, a non-parametric source localization algorithm is derived. It is demonstrated that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms weighted centroid localization algorithms, and, in the low noise regime, a more than 50% of error reduction is observed.

AB  - Principal component analysis (PCA) is a well-established approach commonly used for dimensionality reduction. However, its computational cost and memory requirements hamper the adoption of PCA in heavily resource-constrained embedded platforms. Streaming approaches have been proposed that may enable embedded implementations of the PCA. Among them, the history PCA (HPCA) algorithm stands out for its robustness to the variability in parameters and accuracy. This article presents a parallel and memory-efficient implementation of HPCA in a structural health monitoring (SHM) application based on a heterogeneous network with sensor nodes measuring three-axial accelerations and gateways collecting measurements from several nodes and sending them to the cloud storage and analytic facility. In the targeted application, standard PCA reaches 15x compression factor with an average reconstruction signal-to-noise ratio of 16 dB and a negligible impact on the accuracy in the tracking of structural modal frequencies. By embedding HPCA on our SHM network gateways, we achieve the same compression factor as standard PCA, with more than 1000x reduction in data memory footprint for running the algorithm. Furthermore, we parallelize HPCA on the gateway, and we achieve a speedup of 7.1x (on 8 cores). Finally, we explore a fixed-point HPCA implementation on sensors (network end nodes), that maximally distributes compression workload, minimizes required communication bandwidth, and maintains the same quality of reconstruction as HPCA in floating point, with a compression factor of 10x.

AB  - Compressed Sensing has allowed a significant reduction of acquisition times in MRI, especially in the high resolution (e.g., 400 μm) context. However, in this setting CS must be combined with parallel reception as multichannel coil acquisitions maintain high input signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). To get rid of usual parallel imaging limitations (output SNR loss), non-Cartesian trajectories provide a gain in sampling efficiency in the CS context. In this paper, we propose a self-calibrating MRI reconstruction framework that handles variable density sampling. Low resolution sensitivity maps are estimated from the low frequency k-space content using an original and fast method while MR images are reconstructed using a nonlinear iterative algorithm, which promotes sparsity in the wavelet domain. As regards the optimization task, we compare three first-order proximal gradient methods: Forward Backward (FB), Fast Iterative Soft Thresolding Algorithm (FISTA) and Proximal Optimized Gradient Method (POGM) and evaluate their respective convergence speed. Comparison with state-of-the-art (i.e., ℓl-ESPIRiT) suggests that our self-calibrating POGM-based algorithm outperforms current approaches both in terms of image quality and computing time on several acquired data collected at 7 Tesla and we will focus more specifically on prospective non-Cartesian 8-fold accelerated in vivo Human brain data.

AB  - In this paper, we propose a novel speech enhancement paradigm which can effectively solve the problem of retrieving a desired speech signal in a multi-talker environment. The proposed speech enhancement paradigm involves a three-step procedure consisting of separation, ranking, and enhancement. First, a speech separation system – which could be a conventional spatial filter bank or more advanced separation systems – separates mixtures of speech signals captured by microphones into speech signals from candidate speakers. Next, novel ranking algorithms – proposed in this paper – are applied to determine the talker-of-interest amongst the separated speech signals. Finally, the speech signal of the talker-of-interest is estimated as a linear combination of the separated signals, whose weights are determined by the ranking algorithms. We propose ranking algorithms, which exploit turn-taking patterns between conversational partners in order to determine the talker-of-interest amongst competing speakers. Unlike some existing solutions, our ranking algorithms do not require access to additional sensors, e.g., EEG electrodes, cameras, etc., but only rely on microphone signals. Specifically, the proposed algorithms rank the separated speech signals based on the probability of speech overlaps and gaps with the user’s own voice. The speech signal with highest ranking is the talker with minimum probability of speech overlap and gap with the user’s own voice. The proposed ranking algorithms are shown highly effective at determining the talker-of-interest, since conversational partners, i.e., the user and the talker-of-interest, behaviorally avoid speech overlaps and gaps. We evaluate the proposed speech enhancement paradigm in two practical hearing aid related applications, where the objective is to enhance a speech signal of a conversational partner in a multi-talker environment. The results of the evaluation demonstrate that the proposed speech enhancement systems in both applications significantly outperform conventional speech enhancement systems.

AB  - Ultrasonic guided wave testing technology is currently widely used in industrial nondestructive testing (NDT), including defect detection in the floors of large tanks and oil pipelines. However, in addition to noise, practical scenarios of signal detection also present mode aliasing problems, which make it difficult to accurately identify and locate defects. In this paper, we propose an improved shear horizontal guided wave mode identification method using a variational mode decomposition (VMD) algorithm and a time-of-flight (TOF) extraction method using the synchrosqueezed wavelet transform (SSWT) algorithm. Moreover, we use the wavelet denoising method to denoise the original signal before applying VMD. The results show that the TOF errors obtained by the VMD method are all less than 5% and that the wavelet denoising of the original guided wave data can further reduce the errors (to less than 2%). In addition, the SSWT can modify the time-frequency analysis results of intrinsic mode functions obtained by the VMD method and provides accurate TOF data for different modes. Therefore, the proposed ultrasonic guided wave signal method is helpful for improving the defect detection sensitivity and accuracy of SH waves.

AB  - The rich spectral information provided by hyperspectral imaging has made this technology very useful in the classification of remotely sensed data. However, classification of hyperspectral data is typically affected by noise and the Hughes phenomenon due to the presence of hundreds of spectral bands and correlation among them, with usually a limited number of samples for training. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is a well-known technique that has been widely used for supervised dimensionality reduction of hyperspectral data. However, the use of LDA in hyperspectral remote sensing is limited due to its poor performance on small training datasets and the limited number of features that can be selected i.e., $c - 1$, where $c$ is the number of classes in the data. To solve these problems, this article presents a folded LDA (F-LDA) for dimensionality reduction of remotely sensed HSI data in small sample size scenarios. The proposed approach allows many more discriminant features to be selected in comparison to the conventional LDA since the selection is no longer bound by the limiting factor, leading to significantly higher accuracy in the classification of pixels under SSS restrictions. The proposed approach is evaluated on five different datasets, where the experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the F-LDA to the conventional LDA in terms of not only higher classification accuracy but also reduced computational complexity, and reduced contiguous memory requirements.

AB  - This work introduces new binaural beamforming algorithms for hearing aids, with a good robustness to errors in the estimated target source propagation model. Two different binaural beamforming designs are proposed. One design is based on an adaptive null positioning scheme, and the second is based on a combination of the adaptive null positioning scheme and wider beampatterns. Simulations are performed using signals and propagation models obtained from multichannel binaural hearing aids recordings, including some in a mildly reverberant environment. Evaluations are done in terms of noise reduction and target distortion. Evaluation results illustrate the robustness of the two proposed designs to errors between the true and estimated directions of arrival for the target source, and to mismatch between the anechoic propagation models used for the beamformers designs and the reverberant propagation models used to generate the signals at the sensors or beamformer inputs. Both designs surpass the performance of standard binaural Minimum Variance Distortionless Response (MVDR) and binaural Generalized-Side Lobe Canceler (GSC) beamformers.

AB  - Most of the reconstruction-based robust adaptive beamforming (RAB) algorithms require the covariance matrix reconstruction (CMR) by high-complexity integral computation. A Gauss-Legendre quadrature (GLQ) method with the highest algebraic precision in the interpolation-type quadrature is proposed to reduce the complexity. The interference angular sector in RAB is regarded as the GLQ integral range, and the zeros of the three-order Legendre orthogonal polynomial is selected as the GLQ nodes. Consequently, the CMR can be efficiently obtained by simple summation with respect to the three GLQ nodes without integral. The new method has significantly reduced the complexity as compared to most state-of-the-art reconstruction-based RAB techniques, and it is able to provide the similar performance close to the optimal. These advantages are verified by numerical simulations.

AB  - We report a real-time high-speed fiber Bragg grating (FBG) interrogator based on a fiber-optic interferometer. The signal processing is performed by using a low-cost field-programmable gate array (FPGA) system, which is programed to implement a phase-generated carrier (PGC) demodulation algorithm with multitone mixing (MTM) to provide distortion-free signals with high tolerance to modulation depth variations and light intensity fluctuations. The system can stream data at rates up to 1 MS/s and allows multiplexed processing up to two channels. Experimental results show simultaneous measurements of two FBGs, one of which was actuated at frequencies up to 100 kHz. The system features a 3-dB bandwidth of 280 kHz, and a dynamic wavelength resolution of 4.7 fm/Hz $^{\mathrm {1/2}}$ . We also demonstrate a strong reduction of distortion using the MTM approach with respect to the standard technique. Finally, we study the origin of the noise, demonstrating a reduction in common noise sources by using one of the FBGs as a reference. The system can measure FBGs centered at any position within the spectral band of the source, is polarization-independent, and is easily scalable to more than two measurement channels from the same interferometer.

By using an embedded notch filter, major characteristic harmonic contained in position estimated and motor vibration are attenuated, and high frequency noise signal is suppressed at the same time. A random algorithm based on a two-state Markov chain is presented to realize randomization of injected frequency. The random algorithm is effective in homogenizing current spectrum and reducing motor vibration peak value caused by high frequency signal injected. Finally, the correctness of theoretical analysis and effectiveness of the proposed strategy are verified by simulation.

AB  - Many multi-microphone speech enhancement algorithms require the relative transfer function (RTF) vector of the desired speech source, relating the acoustic transfer functions of all array microphones to a reference microphone. In this paper, we propose a computationally efficient method to estimate the RTF vector in a diffuse noise field, which requires an additional microphone that is spatially separated from the microphone array, such that the spatial coherence between the noise components in the microphone array signals and the additional microphone signal is low. Assuming this spatial coherence to be zero, we show that an unbiased estimate of the RTF vector can be obtained. Based on real-world recordings experimental results show that the proposed RTF estimator outperforms state-of-the-art estimators using only the microphone array signals in terms of estimation accuracy and noise reduction performance.

AB  - Limited by the micro-electromechanical system (MEMS) fabrication technology, the in-operation drift of MEMS gyroscope which degrades measurement repeatability, accuracy, and stability has non-stationary wide-band components and a large difference between each power cycle. The drift limits the usability of MEMS gyroscope in a variety of field applications where autonomous and repeatable operation is required over a long time in harsh environmental conditions. Therefore, a novel method is proposed to compensate the drift. At first, an improved complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition is used to decompose the original signals into a series of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs), and the threshold de-noising method is adopted to filter the IMFs; then, the de-noised sub-series are reconstructed into training and testing dataset, respectively, and the bagging extreme learning machine-based model has been trained; finally, the compensation signal is predicted by the model with testing dataset, and the desired results can be obtained after compensation. The proposed method has been validated by a 9000-s in-operation experiment of CRG20 by comparing it with a typical method. The experiment demonstrated that the proposed method can enhance generalization performance and can boost compensation accuracy of the model, and the bias instability reduced from 0.0785°/s to 0.0046°/s.

AB  - In the last few years, forensic researchers have developed a wide set of techniques to blindly attribute an image to the device used to shoot it. Among these techniques, those based on photo response non uniformity (PRNU) have shown incredibly accurate results, thus they are often considered as a reference baseline solution. The rationale behind these techniques is that each camera sensor leaves on acquired images a characteristic noise pattern. This pattern can be estimated and uniquely mapped to a specific acquisition device through a cross-correlation test. In this paper, we study the possibility of leveraging recent findings in the deep learning field to attack PRNU-based detectors. Specifically, we focus on the possibility of editing an image through convolutional neural networks in a visually imperceptible way, still hindering PRNU noise estimation. Results show that performing such an attack is possible, even though an informed forensic analyst can reduce its impact through a smart test.

AB  - Mutual interference in automotive radar scenarios is going to become a major concern as the density of vehicles with radar sensors in the roads increases. The present work tackles the problem tackles the problem of frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) to FMCW interference. In this context, we propose a signal processing technique to blindly identify and remove interference by using the fast Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) algorithm to project the interference signals in a reduced chirplet basis, and separate it from the target signal with minimal loss of information. Significant reduction of the noise-plus-interference levels are observed in measured data acquired with state of the art automotive sensors.

AB  - A 16-channel closed-loop neuromodulation system-on-chip (SoC) for human epileptic seizure control is proposed and designed. In the proposed SoC, a 16-channel neural-signal acquisition unit (NSAU), a biosignal processor (BSP), a 16-channel high-voltage-tolerant stimulator (HVTS), and wireless power and bidirectional data telemetry are designed. In the NSAU, the input protection circuit is used to prevent MOSFET from overstressing by the high-voltage stimulations. Hence, NSAUs can share electrodes with stimulators. The auto-reset chopper-stabilized capacitive-coupled instrumentation amplifiers (AR-CSCCIAs) are designed with the chopper-stabilized technique with a new offset reduction loop. The measured input-referred noise is 2.09 μVrms and the noise-efficiency factor (NEF) is 3.78. The entropy-and-spectrum seizure detection algorithm is implemented in the BSP with 0.76-s seizure detection latency and 97.8% detection accuracy. When the seizure onset is detected by the BSP, the HVTS with adaptive supply control delivers 0.5-3-mA biphasic current stimulation to suppress the seizure onset. The proposed SoC is powered wirelessly, and the bidirectional data telemetry is realized through the same pair of coils in 13.56 MHz. The downlink data rate is 211 Kb/s with the binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) modulation and a new BPSK demodulator. The uplink data rate is 106 Kb/s with the load-shift keying (LSK) modulation. The proposed SoC is fabricated in a 0.18-μm CMOS technology and occupies 25 mm2. Electrical tests have been performed to characterize the SoC performance. In vivo animal experiments using mini-pigs have been performed to successfully verify the closed-loop neuromodulation functions on epileptic seizure suppression.

AB  - Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) is a method to measure cardiac activities without any contact sensors. Non-contact sensors include radar, laser, and digital cameras, and there have been wide developments regarding the measurement of rPPG signals using continuous face frames. However, non-contact sensors are quite sensitive to the subject's motion, which causes motion artifacts. In this paper, two hypotheses are proposed: a) the motion artifacts are caused by unevenly reflected light due to the curvature of the subject's face; and b) melanin and residuals in the continuous face frames are time-varying values whenever the subject's movement is triggered. Adaptive noise cancellation based on recursive least square (ANS based on RLS) using the Lambert-Beer law and the hue-saturation-intensity (HSI) model were applied. The former is used for skin modeling, and the latter is used to reduce noises derived by the curvature of the face. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm is directly applied to two-dimensional continuous face frames and results in the rPPG signal and rPPG image, respectively. To evaluate proposed algorithm, two different experiments (e.g., static and dynamic situation) were conducted. Furthermore, in a study with 15 participants, the performances of heart rate estimation and heart rate variability (HRV) were evaluated by comparing the proposed method with previously developed methods. The results showed that a) the artifacts derived by head movement are efficiently removed, compared to previous methods; and b) rPPG images describing the spread of facial blood flow are acquired in real-time.

AB  - Monitoring of health parameters during physical exercise is an important aspect of both sports and rehabilitation medicine. Photoplethysmography (PPG) is routinely employed for low-cost heart rate (HR) measurement; however, monitoring during physical exercise is made difficult by the presence of motion artifacts. In this paper, we present an approach that combines denoising by subspace decomposition and Fourier-based HR measurement, and finally, smoothing and tracking by a Kalman filter. Using publicly available real-life PPG traces, we demonstrate accuracy and performance by an extensive set of experimental results, comparing them with similar algorithms proposed in the literature.

AB  - This paper proposes a novel method for traffic flow detection using distributed optical fiber acoustic sensing (DAS). Different from the traditional traffic flow detection method, this method detects the traffic vibration signal using a fiber optic cable. Distributed fiber-optic acoustic sensing technology can provide fully distributed acoustic information along the entire fiber link, and thus external acoustic signals from an arbitrary point can be detected and located. This paper uses DAS to obtain traffic vibration data. Using the characteristics of traffic vibration data, this paper proposes an improved wavelet threshold algorithm and an improved dual-threshold algorithm and verifies the feasibility and effectiveness of these methods. Finally, the experimental results from a vehicle-counting test show that the counting error is smaller for a single vehicle passing through the detection area and that the counting error is larger if multiple vehicles pass through the detection area continuously. In vehicle speed estimation, the results show good accuracy, and the error range is controlled to less than 6%.

AB  - Radio interferometry usually compensates for high levels of noise in sensor/antenna electronics by throwing data and energy at the problem: observe longer, then store and process it all. We propose instead a method to remove the noise explicitly before imaging. To this end, we developed an algorithm that first decomposes the instances of antenna correlation matrix, the so-called visibility matrix, into additive components using Singular Spectrum Analysis and then cluster these components using graph Laplacian matrix. We show through simulation the potential for radio astronomy, in particular, illustrating the benefit for LOFAR, the low frequency array in Netherlands. Least-squares images are estimated with far higher accuracy with low computation cost without the need for long observation time.

AB  - Collaborative beamforming (CB) has recently emerged as a promising technique for transmission range extension and energy consumption reduction in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). However, due to the constrained energy and limited data processing capabilities of sensor nodes, the performance optimization of CB mainlobe and sidelobe control (SC) encounters challenges in the practical deployment. To address these challenges, we present an architecture of software-defined energy harvesting WSN (SD-EHWSN) for CB communications. Specifically, we first design the mechanism of CB communications based on the software-defined network (SDN) architecture to reduce the communication and computational overhead of sensor nodes. Then, we consider solar energy-harvesting system to achieve long-term operation of WSN and utilize a stationary Markov (SM) chain to model the arrival process of solar energy. Based on the stochastic nature of solar energy, a stochastic game model is developed to formulate the problem of CB optimization in SD-EHWSN, and the existence proof of Nash equilibria is provided. Based on the analytical results, we propose a reinforcement learning algorithm to maximize the long-term signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) performance with SC and prove the convergence of the algorithm. Simulation results are presented to validate the efficiency of the proposed scheme for CB communications in SD-EHWSN.

The random disturbance model of the rocket launcher is developed based on the rigid body kinematics theory. The trajectory equation of the projectile is given, and a quantitative perturbation algorithm for the launcher and the directional tube is proposed, which provides a theoretical basis for the calculation of the hit rate. Then the MEMS sensor error is processed by quaternion, Kalman filtering and wavelet threshold denoising methods to improve the precision of hit accuracy calculation.

AB  - Conventional transmit subarray partitioning schemes of phased-MIMO radar will cause several problems, the reduction of array aperture, the increase of feeding network complexity and optimization algorithms time cost. Focus on the problems above, this paper proposes a deep learning-based interleaved sparse transmit subarray partitioning method. Firstly, the training data is generated by phased-MIMO array manifold matrix. Secondly, a dimensionality reduction method for radar data is introduced to reduce the dimensionality of the sample data while minimizing information loss. Then, a lightweight convolutional neural network is constructed for training and the optimal array structures is selected by classification. Finally, linear and plane arrays experiment results show that our proposed method can achieve 97.95% classification accuracy, better than other conventional dimensionality reduction methods and neural networks; compared with the traditional SCP partitioning method, our proposed method has similar beampattern sidelobe level and DOA estimation accuracy, but the time cost is greatly reduced.

AB  - In order to prevent people from touching the floor buttons when riding in the elevator in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we propose a design method of elevator auxiliary control system based on speech recognition. The hardware design part of the system includes voice module, photoelectric sensor module and main control circuit module. On the basis of hardware design, the process from recognizing the voice commands of passengers in the elevator car to transmitting the recognition results to the elevator control main system is realized through programming. With the goal of improving the accuracy of speech recognition, the differential feature parameter algorithm based on the Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) is used. Then, our experiments show that least mean square (LMS) adaptive filtering is an effective method for the noise reduction of the voice signal when processing passengers' commands.

AB  - In applications based on radar sensors, target movement can be analyzed using micro-Doppler spectrogram, which is a time-frequency representation of micro-Doppler signature. However, the noise in spectrogram brings difficulties for applications. Conventional denoising algorithms are not specific to micro- Doppler data, they could only deal with a fixed level of noise and fail to effectively denoise under low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) circumstances. To overcome the drawbacks, we propose a method based on Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to remove the noise in micro-Doppler spectrograms. Our method is applicable to a wide range of noise intensity, for which can be called a blind denoiser. We verify the effectiveness of the proposed method on both simulated and measured data, experimental results compared with competing algorithms demonstrate the superiority of our method.

AB  - The Software-defined radio (SDR) technology is considered as a promising solution to address the issue of spectrum scarcity by providing a high level of flexibility and configurability to wireless communication systems. This technology, widely used in cognitive radio (CR) networks, aims at optimizing the spectrum efficiency. However, to reach this objective, a new conception of spectrum sensing methods needs to be adopted. Indeed, in the emerging wireless communications systems, telecom researchers face the challenge of detecting the presence of energy with a very low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in a very complex environment. For this purpose, for complex environments such as CR networks, machine-learning (ML) algorithms seem to be a suitable solution allowing a smart spectrum-sensing scheme. This scheme enables the increase of the signal detection probability and the decrease the false detection probability of signal detection. In this paper, four supervised ML models are compared: Naïve Bayes classifier, Support Vector Machine, Gradient Boosting Machine and Distributed Random Forest. Furthermore, a principal component analysis (PCA) is performed to reduce the dimensionality of the complex dataset while preserving the useful variability. Their performance is subsequently evaluated by computing their receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The entire algorithms are then implemented and demonstrated using the GNU (GNU’s Not Unix) Radio platform and an SDR-based electronic card, HackRF One.

AB  - The fast-growing networked computing devices create many distributed systems and generate new signals on a large scale. Typical applications include peer-to-peer streaming of multimedia data, crowd- sourcing, and measurement by sensor networks. Therefore, the massive amount of networked data is a form of big data, calling for new data structures and algorithms different from classical ones suitable for small data sizes. We consider a vital data format for recording information from networked distributed systems: signals on graphs. A significant concern is to protect the privacy of large scales of signals when processed at third parties, such as cloud data centers. A de-facto solution is to outsource encrypted data before they arrive at the third-parties. We propose a novel and efficient privacy-protected outsourced denoising algorithm based on the information-theoretic secure multi-party computation (secure MPC). Among the operations of signals on graphs, denoising is useful before further meaningful processing can occur. We experiment with our algorithms in a popular platform of secure MPC and compare it with Paillier's homomorphic encryption approach. The results demonstrate a better efficiency of our approach.

AB  - The localization of short events arising within a network subsequently leading to wave propagation into it, is of interest in many applications. This work extend (Caputo et al., 2019) which demonstrated the identifiability of a source from two detectors in a $N$ nodes graph. We show that, rather than a source, a boundary condition identification is also possible and demonstrate a generalyzed unicity result. Furthermore, we extend the identification algorithm proposed in (Caputo et al., 2019) to an arbitrary number of sensors, and estimate its complexity which depends on sensors number $N_{s}$ and time dicretisation $N_{t}$. Increasing detectors number increases source identification robustness to noise up to a cut-off number being a small raction of $N$. This cutt-off detector density for efficiency in noise reduction is of practical significance. We also analyze and discuss the method sensitivity to total recording time $T_{e}$, sampling frequency, and signal to noise ratio. Finally we propose a pre-sectorisation to improve the systematic exploration algorithm proposed in (Caputo et al., 2019) and we show a $O(N)$ drop in complexity leading to a $O(N^{3})$ cost for the source identification. Several tests of the method on model and real graphs confirm and support the presented results.

AB  - Independent Component Analysis (ICA) has emerged as a useful method for separation of components, such as in removing noise from data. We examine one of the challenges of ICA - instability, particularly in high dimensions, when the independent components vary, each time when ICA is performed. This may be due to various causes including the stochastic nature of the algorithm and the additive noise. The objective of this study is to examine denoising and stability issues of ICA in high dimensions and make a comparative evaluation of select approaches. We take a challenging electrocardiogram dataset which is a high-dimensional time series of multiple sensors. We experiment with a mix of approaches and methods - for resampling, clustering, ICA algorithms and dimensionality. We check the internal validity using the Icasso stability index, the Amari separation performance index and the Minimum Distance (MD) index. The first key contribution of this work is that it finds counter-evidence to the claim that resampling (bootstrapping) tackles the question of stability. The second contribution is that it finds evidence of an important limitation of the Minimum Distance index when dealing with high dimensional data - the index may become highly concentrated and may remain sub-optimal at all dimensions. Selectively removing noise components by visual inspection can improve the Amari, the Icasso or the MD index values. Some automated tools exist, but in high dimensions, visual inspection of the individual components is still required for effective denoising - data driven methods are not good enough.

AB  - For new military aircraft a specification of sensor characteristics and performance is required at an early stage in the design cycle, well before testing of a prototype. In the early days of military aviation the Johnson criteria [1] were used to determine the sensor resolution required for target recognition by a human. In the present day sensor data are processed by computer using various Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) algorithms. However there is no accepted method for predicting the sensor resolution and SNR required for reliable ATR and hence there is risk that any chosen sensor may fail to support the required ATR performance. This paper reports a study into the use of publicly-available CAD models for aircraft to address this requirement. The study considers the worst-case confusion between two views of 15 different aircraft types. For simplicity only rotations by an angle θ about the Z (vertical) axis are considered. Firstly the sensor resolution and noise level is fixed. Then for each aircraft type and view angle an ensemble of synthetic silhouettes are generated. Using these ensembles, a-posteriori distributions of 5 standard scale-invariant shape features (eccentricity, orientation, solidity, circularity and bounding box aspect ratio) are estimated for each view angle θ. The performance of ATR at the given resolution and noise level is predicted by estimating the Bayes Error Rate [2] when deciding between each aircraft type and the 14 non-matching types using these features. The worst-case confusion in terms of erroneous aircraft type and view angle is identified. The sensor resolution is then changed and the above process repeated to investigate the effect of varying sensor resolution on performance. As expected, high sensor resolution leads to low probability of misclassification, even in the worst-case. Reduction in resolution and increasing noise level causes the Bayes Error Rate to rise quickly. The Bayes Error Rate gives a fundamental limit to the reliability of classification, irrespective of the actual type of classification algorithm used. The predictions from the model are confirmed by testing against a standard classifier for specific discrimination examples. Further development of the approach presented is expected to yield a method for specifying sensor resolution requirements for specific ATR problems.

AB  - The ability to track people's movement (e.g., the human walking) is an important topic of interest in numerous research areas. State-of-the-art systems based on, e.g., dead reckoning, usually do not need any additional infrastructure. The disadvantage of the method is the poor accuracy because of measurement noises. The typical approach to noise cancellation is zero-velocity update (ZUPT). The method takes advantages of the cyclical nature of human walking. Thus some limitations of the ZUPT approach we propose the novel method based on transient artifact reduction algorithm (TARA) to mitigate these errors by noise estimation. TARA is the novel approach to estimate the low-frequency components in the signals by applying the concept of sparse optimization. The proposed algorithm was validated on synthetic and real signals. The tests for synthetic signals were performed for pulse signals with noise characterized by the Hurst exponent. In real signals studies, we applied the signals from three different data sets that were prepared to test the algorithm to human walking estimation. We found that TARA can estimate the underlying noise in the dead-reckoning-based systems. The results show that the TARA method can be used to improve the accuracy of human walking speed estimation as an alternative to the state-of-the-art method such as ZUPT. The results prove to be the important step toward unaided estimation of human walking velocity based on dead-reckoning technique.

AB  - We present a novel approach to locate microseismic sources in situ and in real time in distributed sensor networks (DSN). We propose a distributed reverse time migration (RTM) microseismic source location algorithm. RTM-based methods have advantages in passive source location in terms of robustness and accuracy. However, the traditional methods have a centralized data collection and ex situ postprocessing style, and were not designed for in situ and real-time seismic imaging, so communication and computation costs were not considered. Utilizing newly emerging DSN, real-time and in situ microseismic source location becomes possible. Thus, we specially design a joint imaging condition for the DSN system to reduce both computation and communication burdens. The tradeoff, however, is location resolution reduction. Sequentially, we employ a waveform inversion approach to obtain a finer resolution microseismic source location result. Finally, we validate the proposed method using both synthetic and field seismic records. Our approach shows promising performances using synthetics with single and multiple sources, as well as with field data. The proposed waveform inversion-assisted distributed RTM location algorithm obtains high-resolution source location results and significantly reduced communication and computation costs, even at a low signal-to-noise ratio.

AB  - Our capacity to transmit data off of a spacecraft to the ground station has not kept pace with rate of data generation from advanced sensors. One solution is to reduce the size of the data prior to transmission through advanced compression techniques. In this paper, software and hardware implementations of a novel data compression algorithm were used to compress overhead persistent infrared data with synthetic embedded dim targets. An image processing technique was subsequently applied to the decompressed data to recover the embedded targets within the image stack, and the signal-to-noise ratio of the detected targets were examined as a function of compression ratio. This paper examines the detection signal-to-noise ratio and relative speed-up for compression of 1200 frames of infrared data implemented in a general-purpose processor and a field-programmable gate array. The advantages of the FPGA implementation for processing efficiency were clearly shown, however, the reduced data precision had a negative impact on our ability to recover the dim target from the post compressed data.

AB  - HDR images have traditionally been obtained by merging multiple exposures each captured with a different exposure time. However, this approach entails longer capture times and necessitates deghosting if the captured scene contains moving objects. With the advent of modern camera sensors that can perform per-pixel exposure modulation, it is now possible to capture all of the required exposures within a single shot. The new challenge then becomes how to best combine different pixels with different exposure values into a single full-resolution and low-noise HDR image. We propose a joint multi-exposure frame deinterlacing and denoising algorithm powered by deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN). In our algorithm, we first train two DCNNs, with one tuned for reconstructing low exposures and the other for high exposures. Each DCNN takes the same mosaicked dual-ISO input image and outputs either the low exposure or high exposure depending on the type of the network. The resulting exposures can be demosaicked and converted to the desired target color space prior to HDR assembly. Our evaluations indicate that the quality of our results significantly surpasses the state-of-the-art in single-image HDR reconstruction algorithms.

AB  - Hyperspectral imaging technology has been popularly applied in remote sensing because it collects echoed signals from across the electromagnetic (EM) spectrum and thereby contributes fruitfully spatial-spectral information. However, the processing or storage of high-data-volume hyperspectral images (HSIs), also viewed as snapshots varying with the EM spectrum, burdens the hardware resources, especially for the high spectral resolution and spatial resolution cases. To address this challenge, a novel unsupervised dimensionality reduction method based on the dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) algorithm is proposed to analyze hyperspectral data. This method decomposes the spatial-spectral HSIs in terms of spatial dynamic modes and corresponding spectral patterns. Then, these spatial-spectral patterns are combined to reconstruct the raw HSIs via a low-rank model. Furthermore, we extend the proposed DMD method to hyperspectral data in the tensor form and title it CubeDMD to actualize the compression of HSIs in horizontal, vertical, and spectral dimensions. Our proposed data-driven scheme is benchmarked by the real hyperspectral data measured at the Salinas scenes and Pavia University. It is demonstrated that the HSIs can be reconstructed accurately and effectively by the proposed low-rank model. The mean peak signal-to-noise ratio between the reconstructed and original HSIs can reach 31.47 dB, and the corresponding mean spectral angle mapper is only 0.1037. Our work provides a useful tool for the analysis of HSIs with a low-rank representation.

AB  - For fiber-optic sensing signal recognition systems, signal feature extraction is the key to determining the accuracy of signal recognition and classification. Mel frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) can be used for feature extraction of optical fiber signals. In order to further improve the accuracy of fiber vibration signal pattern recognition, this paper proposes a feature extraction algorithm based on Compensation Distance Estimation Technology (CDET). The algorithm first extracts the MFCC feature vector from the optical fiber vibration signal, uses the compensation distance estimation technology to evaluate the feature through the feature screening strategy, and optimizes the feature by deleting the redundant vector. In order to verify the effectiveness of the algorithm, the traditional MFCC algorithm and the PCA algorithm dimensionality reduction and the proposed algorithm are used to compare the classification experiments. The experimental results show that the feature extraction method based on CDET can further improve the accuracy of the classification results by 5%. After adding different signal-to-noise ratio noises, classification experiments are performed to verify that the proposed algorithm has certain anti-noise performance.

AB  - MEMS sensors have been used in many applications including navigation systems. However, these sensors suffer from highly noisy measurements. If left untreated, these errors will significantly degrade the ultimate navigational solution. Hence, applying a pre-filtering technique becomes a necessity to de-noise these sensor signals to improve the overall system performance. While wavelet denoising is the most common technique for sensor data pre-filtering, it may not be suitable for real-time implementations. This paper explores another method; namely, Savitzky-Golay filters, which can provide competitive denoising performance with a less computationally demanding algorithm. The purpose of the paper is to examine the performance of the new method against wavelet de-noising with respect to both positioning and attitude accuracy and computations time. We applied the filter to denoise MEMS-based inertial sensors data in a tightly coupled integrated INS/GPS system. Our results showed that the new method outperformed the wavelet denoising approach. Moreover, the new method demands much less computations time, which makes it more suitable for embedded systems and real-time applications.

AB  - This paper proposes a novel fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) technique for grid-tied PV systems. The proposed approach deals with system uncertainties (current/voltage variability, noise, measurement errors, ⋯) by using an interval-valued data representation, and with large-scale systems by using a dataset size-reduction framework. The failures encompassed in this study are the open-circuit/short-circuit, islanding, output current sensor, and partial shading faults. In the proposed FDD approach, named interval reduced kernel PCA (IRKPCA)-based Random Forest (IRKPCA-RF), the feature extraction and selection phase is performed using the IRKPCA models while the fault classification is ensured using the RF algorithm. The main contribution of the proposed approach is to provide a good trade-off between low computation time and high classification metrics. The performance of the proposed IRKPCA-RF approach is assessed using a set of emulated data of a grid-tied PV system operating under healthy and faulty conditions. The presented results show that the proposed IRKPCA-RF approach is characterized by enhanced diagnosis metrics, classification rate, and computation time compared to the classical techniques.

AB  - This paper presents a cumulant-based algorithm for near-field noncircular sources localization with a symmetric uniform linear array. It first constructs three extended matrices. Then, based on the rotational invariance property in extended cumulant-domain signal subspace, coarse direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimates are obtained. With the course results used as reference, the algorithm is able to disambiguate the cyclic phase ambiguities when the equivalent sub-array spacing exceeds a half wavelength. Thus, higher precision DOA estimates can be obtained. Finally, with the estimated DOAs, only one-dimensional searching is needed to obtain the range estimates via rank-reduction algorithm. The proposed algorithm avoids two-dimensional searching and parameters pairing. In addition, compared with the existing near-field noncircular sources localization algorithm, the significant characteristic of the proposed algorithm is that it exploits cumulant and the noncircularity of signal to achieve extended steering vector. Cumulant is insensitive to Gaussian (white or color) noise. Consequently, the proposed one provides DOA estimates with improved precision especially at low signal-to-noise ratios. Furthermore, it doubles the number of detectable sources. Total least square ESPRIT algorithm is exploited to yield search free estimates of near-field bearing parameters. Computer simulations are carried out to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm.

AB  - Human breath analysis plays important role for diagnosis and management of pulmonary diseases to guarantee normal health. The critical task is to distinguish normal and abnormal lung sounds. This research work presents a scheme for breath analysis used to detect irregular patterns occurred in respiratory cycles due to respiratory diseases. After de-noising breath segments using wavelet de-noising method, intrinsic mode functions are extracted with complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition (CEEMD). Instantaneous frequency (IF) and instantaneous envelope are extracted to get robust features for classification. The study contains breath samples captured using smartphone under natural setting. The data set contains 255 breath cycles. For cycle classification, Bag-of-word was applied to group segments based features. The support vector machine (SVM) was applied on randomly partitioned data samples. Experiments resulted with performance accuracy of (75.21%±2) for asthmatic inspiratory cycles and (75.5%±3%) for complete Respiratory Sounds (RS) cycle with diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) of 20.61% and 13.S7% respectively.

AB  - Deep learning methods have shown early progress in analyzing complicated ECG signals, especially in heartbeat classification and arrhythmia detection. However, there is still a long way to go in terms of health-related data analysis. This research provides a duel structured and bidirectional Recurrent Neural Network(RNN) method for arrhythmia classification that addresses the issues with multilayered dilated convolution neural network (CNN) models. Initially, the data is preprocessed by Chebyshev Type II filtering that is faster and do not use statistical characteristics. Noise from the preprocesed filter is aslo removed by using Daubechies wavelet that can able to solve fractal problems and signal discontinuities. An then Z-normalization is done using Pan-Tompkins normalization technique for handling of different normally distributed samples. Finally, a generative adversarial network (GAN)-based synthetic signal is generated for recreation of signal to handle imbalanced signal class. The proposed Bidirectional RNN with Dilated CNN (BRDC) appears to take advantage of the potentiality of multilayered dilated CNN and bidirectional RNN unit (bidirectional gated recurrent Units, BiGRU - bidirectional long short-term memory, BiLSTM) architecture to generate fusion features. Finally, the signals are classified by fully connected layer and Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function. The PhysioNet 2017 challenge dataset is used to train and validate the proposed model. By combining fusion features with dilated CNN, the learned model significantly improves the classification performance and interpretability. The experimental findings show that, for MIT-BIH provided ECG (electrocardiogram) data to identify arrhythmia, the proposed BRDC model outperforms existing models with 99.90 % accuracy, 98.41 % F1, 97.96 % precision, and 99.90 % recall during training. One of the significant findings of this study is that the proposed approach can significantly reduce time length when employing RNN networks with multilayered dilated CNN. Overall, our hybrid model using BiGRU-BiLSTM and multi-layered dilated CNN provides a cost-effective ECG signal reduction and high-performance automated recognition technique to identify arrhythmia. Our future improvement will focus on the classification of numerous arrhythmia signal-based data, automatic and cloud based ECG classification.

AB  - One basic operation of Internet-of-Things (IoT) networks is to acquire a function of distributed data collected from sensors over wireless channels, called wireless data aggregation (WDA). In the presence of dense sensors, low-latency WDA poses a design challenge for high-mobility or mission critical IoT applications. A promising solution is a low-latency multi-access scheme, called over-the-air computing (AirComp), that supports simultaneous transmission such that an access point (AP) can estimate and receive a summation-form function of the distributed sensing data by exploiting the waveform-superposition property of a multi-access channel. In this work, we propose a multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) AirComp framework for an IoT network with clustered multi-antenna sensors and an AP with large receive arrays. The framework supports low-complexity and low-latency AirComp of a vector-valued function. The contributions of this work are two-fold. Define the AirComp error as the error in the functional value received at AP due to channel noise. First, under the criterion of minimum error, the optimal receive beamformer at the AP, called decomposed aggregation beamformer (DAB), is shown to have a decomposed architecture: the inner component focuses on channel-dimension reduction and the outer component focuses on joint equalization of the resultant low-dimensional small-scale fading channels. In addition, an algorithm is designed to adjust the ranks of individual components of the DAB for a further performance improvement. Second, to provision DAB with the required channel state information (CSI), a low-latency channel feedback scheme is proposed by intelligently leveraging the AirComp principle to support simultaneous channel feedback by sensors. The proposed framework is shown by simulation to substantially reduce AirComp error compared with the existing design without considering channel structures.

AB  - Multispectral filter arrays (MSFA) is increasingly used in multispectral imaging. While many previous works studied the denoising algorithms for CFA based cameras, denoising MSFA raw images is little discussed. The major challenges for denoising MSFA data include 1) more channels than CFA and no predominant channel; 2) compatibility between denoising and the subsequent demosaicking process. To overcome these challenges, we propose a new deep residual network designed to account for the uniqueness of MSFA mosaic patterns. First, a split and stride convolution layer is innovated to match the mosaic pattern of the MSFA raw image. Then, data augmentation using MSFA shifting and dynamic noise is proposed to make the model robust to different noise levels. In addition, a new network optimization criteria is also suggested by using the noise standard deviation to normalize the L1 loss function. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed deep residual network outperforms the state-of-the-art denoising algorithms in MSFA field.

AB  - In this paper, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a scheme of deep learning enhanced long-range fast Brillouin optical time-domain analysis (BOTDA). The volumetric data from fast BOTDA is denoised and demodulated by using a deep video denoising network and a deep neural network, respectively. Benefitting from the advanced deep learning algorithms, the sensing range of fast BOTDA is extended to 10 km successfully. In experiment, vibration signal is measured with a sampling rate of 23 Hz, 2 m spatial resolution, and 1.19 MHz accuracy over 10 km single-mode fiber with only 4 averages. Due to the low computational complexity and GPU acceleration, the network takes less than 0.04 s to process 100 × 21800 data, which is much faster than the conventional algorithms. This method provides the potential for real-time vibration measurement in fast BOTDA with long sensing range.

AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is a very high and accurate technology for remote sensing. SAR images are very exploited for change detection and monitoring because of their high resolution. Because of the coherent retro diffusion of the backscattered radar waves with the rigorous earth surface, SAR images are characterized by a multiplicative noise called speckle that influences their analysis. For this reason, several methods and algorithms have been introduced for speckle noise reduction from these images. This paper proposes and exploits a convolution neural network (CNN) based technique for SAR image denoising. The performance of the introduced technique is studied firstly by using numerical simulation where we added speckle noise with a different variance; then, a quantitative appraisal is presented by using three metrics: Peak to signal noise ratio (PSNR), Edge preservation index (EPI) and image quality index (Q). Finally, we apply the proposed method on a real SAR image obtained by the Sentinel-l satellite and ERSSAR sensor.

AB  - Detection of breast cancer in its early stage is critical for reducing the death rate. In this paper, a compact and flexible breast tumor sensing system is designed using dual-polarized UWB antenna arrays. Each UWB unit is composed of two orthogonally placed circular monopoles, which are printed on flexible and low-profile Kapton polyimide. The antennas are fed by single-side coplanar waveguides for size reduction. A wide band from 3.9 GHz to 19 GHz is obtained, with an isolation of above 16 dB over the operating band. High fidelity factors are achieved at different solid angles, indicating little distortion of the signal and stable sensing ability. To obtain the image of the tumor, eight UWB units are employed surrounding the breast phantom. Using the reflected and scattered signals from the antennas, 3D images of the breast are reconstructed using delay-and-sum (DAS) algorithm. Attributed to the dual-polarized UWB antennas, accurate location and size of the tumors are retained with little clutter. Moreover, the proposed system can detect two tumors with an edge to edge distance of 15 mm. Experiments have been carried out on rotating platforms, with the tumor successfully detected in the measurement. The proposed tumor sensing system is suitable for wearable applications due to its compact size and flexibility.

AB  - Using Kinect sensors to monitor and provide feedback to patients performing intervention or rehabilitation exercises is an upcoming trend in healthcare. However, the joint positions measured by the Kinect sensor are often unreliable, especially for joints that are occluded by other parts of the body. Also, users' motion sequences differ significantly even when doing the same exercise and are not temporally aligned, making the evaluation of the correctness of their movement challenging. This paper aims to develop a Kinect-based intervention system, which can guide the users to perform the exercises more effectively. To circumvent the unreliability of the Kinect measurements, we developed a denoising algorithm using a Gaussian Process regression model. We simultaneously capture the joint positions using both a Kinect sensor and a motion capture (MOCAP) system during a training stage and train a Gaussian process regression model to map the noisy Kinect measurements to the more accurate MOCAP measurements. For the sequences alignment issue, we develop a gradient-weighted dynamic time warping approach that can automatically recognize the endpoints of different subsequences from the original user's motion sequence, and furthermore temporally align the subsequences from multiple actors. During a live exercise session, the system applies the same alignment algorithm to a live-captured Kinect sequence to divide it into subsequences, and furthermore compare each subsequence with its corresponding reference subsequence, and generates feedback to the user based on the comparison results. Our results show that the denoised Kinect measurements by the proposed denoising algorithm are more accurate than several benchmark methods and the proposed temporal alignment approach can precisely detect the end of each subsequence in an exercise with very small amount of delay. These methods have been integrated into a prototype system for guiding patients with risks for breast-cancer related lymphedema to perform a set of lymphatic exercises. The system can provide relevant feedback to the patient performing an exercise in real time.

AB  - The Internet of Underwater Things (IoUT) gradually becomes the future direction of ocean. Many devices, which are called the sources, are deployed in the sea to fulfill scientific, civilian, and military needs. If the locations of these sources are leaked, it will cause a serious economic and military crisis. Thus, in this context, the source location privacy protection becomes critical. In this paper, we focus on the source location privacy protection of underwater acoustic sensor networks (UASNs), where a multi-channel interference based source location privacy protection scheme (MCISLP) is proposed. The MCISLP mainly contains four steps. First, to enhance the sense of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) for nodes, a noise reduction method is proposed. Then, based on the previous step, an AUV movement prediction method for nodes is presented to ensure the success of packet transmission. After that, for the information exchange among nodes, given the interference of multiple underwater channels, this interference is then utilized to protect the source location privacy. Further, to reduce the channel interference on the source packet, the time slot control is added to weaken the influence. Last, the ant colony algorithm is adopted for the data collection of AUV. The simulation results show that the MCISLP can increase the network safety time by up to 57$\%$ (compared with data collection algorithms), and balance the energy consumption of nodes (for about 20$\%$ energy saving), with a minor compromise of energy consumption of AUV and delay.

AB  - Monitoring the wear debris in lubricant systems is an effective method of reflecting the health of mechanical equipment. With the advantages of being simply structured, non-invasive, and insensitive to oil quality, inductive sensors are often deployed for debris detection. However, induced voltages generated by wear debris are usually contaminated by noise and other undesired components, thereby limiting the reliability and availability of the sensors. In this study, a new debris-detection framework is proposed based on an inductive sensor with parallel dual coils. With the aid of a reference signal, a multi least-mean-square adaptive weighting filtering method was developed, and good noise suppression was achieved with little violation of the debris signatures. The algorithm is illustrated through numerical simulations, and the effectiveness of the proposed framework was verified by an oil experiment. Two traditional denoising algorithms were also analyzed for comparison. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed strategy had an excellent capability for extracting and identifying debris features.

AB  - Sound source localization from a flying drone is a challenging task due to the strong ego-noise from rotating motors and propellers as well as the movement of the drone and the sound sources. To address this challenge, we propose a deep learning-based framework that integrates single-channel noise reduction and multi-channel source localization. In this framework we suppress the ego-noise and estimate a time-frequency soft ratio mask with a single-channel deep neural network (DNN). Then we design two downstream multi-channel source localization algorithms, based on Steered Response Power (SRP-DNN) and Time-Frequency Spatial filtering (TFS-DNN). The main novelty lies in the proposed TFS-DNN approach, which estimates the presence probability of the target sound at individual time-frequency bins by combining the DNN-inferred soft ratio mask and the instantaneous direction of arrival of the sound received by the microphone array. The time-frequency presence probability of the target sound is then used to design a set of spatial filters to construct a spatial likelihood map for source localization. By jointly exploiting spectral and spatial information, TFS-DNN robustly processes signals in short segments (e.g. 0.5 seconds) in dynamic and low signal-noise-ratio scenarios (e.g. SNR -20 dB). Results on real and simulated data in a variety of scenarios (static sources, moving sources and moving drones) indicate the advantage of TFS-DNN over competing methods, including SRP-DNN and the state-of-the-art time-frequency spatial filtering.

AB  - Several recent studies have attempted to fully replace the conventional camera image signal processing (ISP) pipeline with convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, the previous CNN-based ISPs, simply referred to as ISP-Nets, have not explicitly considered that images have to be lossy-compressed in most cases, especially by the off-the-shelf JPEG. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a novel compression-aware deep camera ISP learning framework. At first, we introduce a new use case of compression artifacts simulation network (CAS-Net), which operates in the opposite way of commonly used compression artifacts reduction networks. Then, the CAS-Net is connected with an ISP-Net such that the ISP network can be trained with consideration of image compression. Throughout experimental studies, we show that our compression-aware camera ISP network can produce images with a better tradeoff between bit-rate and image quality compared to its compression-agnostic version when the performance is evaluated after JPEG compression.

AB  - A novel 96-channel ASIC for simultaneous recording of sEMG signals for muscle fatigue monitoring is presented. Each channel is fully differential such that information regarding the median frequency (MDF) of the sEMG signal can be extracted which has been shown to correlate with muscle fatigue. The analogue front-end of each channel includes a tunable band pass filter and a programmable variable gain, consumes 8.4μW and occupies an area of 0.034mm2. Additionally, the ASIC incorporates compressed sensing (CS) to reduce the data transmitted from all channels into rates achievable using Bluetooth technology. Each on-chip CS module occupies 0.0085mm2 and consumes 17μW per channel with a compression ratio of 10. The reconstructed signal achieves a SNRrecon of 10.2dB and a MARD of 1.7% for the MDF of the sEMG signal, validated using real sEMG recordings. The system architecture is designed in a modular way to ensure scalability for 100+ channels. As such, the system comprises 4 independent readout modules of 24-channels each which include a dedicated multiplexer, ADC and a compressed sensing module for each. The full ASIC is designed in a 0.35 μm CMOS process, occupies an area of 5.82mm2 and has a total power consumption of 3.93mW.

AB  - In the health monitoring of rotating machinery, there often coexists multiple fault sources; thus a multi-source composite fault signal will be collected by sensors. Moreover, the vibration signal of rotating machinery is usually submerged by the environmental noise in practical engineering occasions. These increase the difficulty of separation from the composite fault signal. However, the effect of traditional wavelet analysis method for denoising to enhance features of fault signal is limited, because of the energy dispersion of fault signals. To overcome these problems, we propose a convolutive blind separation method based on peak transform using wavelet analysis. With this strategy, the original signal energy in high frequency is concentrated into that in low frequency band, through some non-linear transformations. Next, the large wavelet coefficients, which represent the main features of the signal, are retained to reconstruct a feature-enhanced signal. The convolutive fixed-point algorithm based on maximization of non-Gaussianity, is carried out to separate source signals from the feature-enhanced signal. Experimental results of rolling bearing show that the proposed strategy can effectively separate source fault signals from the composite signal and detect the fault features.

AB  - The high rate of false alarms in intensive care units (ICUs) is one of the top challenges of using medical technology in hospitals. These false alarms are often caused by patients' movements, detachment of monitoring sensors, or different sources of noise and interference that impact the collected signals from different monitoring devices. In this paper, we propose a novel set of high-level features based on unsupervised feature learning technique in order to effectively capture the characteristics of different arrhythmia in electrocardiogram (ECG) signal and differentiate them from irregularity in signals due to different sources of signal disturbances. This unsupervised feature learning technique, first extracts a set of low-level features from all existing heart cycles of a patient, and then clusters these segments for each individual patient to provide a set of prominent high-level features. The objective of the clustering phase is to enable the classification method to differentiate between the high-level features extracted from normal and abnormal cycles (i.e., either due to arrhythmia or different sources of distortions in signal) in order to put more attention to the features extracted from abnormal portion of the signal that contribute to the alarm.

AB  - In this paper, a three-dimensional (3-D) indoor positioning system (IPS) is designed to realize positioning target, by taking advantage of high precision ranging of Ultra-wide bandwidth (UWB) sensor. The 3-D IPS is composed of UWB sensor, Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi) module and Control Station where the proposed algorithm is running to calculate the position of the moving target. To reduce ranging time as well as clock bias of UWB sensor, the Asymmetry Double-Sided Two-Way Ranging (ADS-TWR) algorithm is proposed. Then, according to the Time Difference of Arrival (TDoA) model, we obtain the TDoA equation. Furthermore, by taking advantage of the ability of quickly getting estimation location of the Chan algorithm and the ability of filtering noise and interference of Extended Kalman filter (EKF), Chan-EKF algorithm is proposed to accurately estimate the 3-D locations of moving target. Experimental and simulation results show that the developed IPS applying with the proposed ADS-TWR algorithm as well as the Chan-EKF algorithm can achieve faster and more accurate position estimations.

AB  - Sparse support recovery from multiple measurement vectors (MMV) is studied in this letter. For years, a noticeable mismatch exists between the theories and algorithms in the research of super-resolution and direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation that variants of separation conditions are assumed to ensure stable recovery while the corresponding algorithms rarely exploit such structural constraints. Due to the discrete nature of the separation condition, we propose to incorporate such prior information in a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) problem with an $\ell _{0}$-based constraint. We develop a specialized branch and bound (B&B) algorithm that can efficiently exploit the separation prior with guaranteed complexity reduction. Moreover, we show that computational complexity can be further reduced by leveraging the sparse array idea along with a particular perspective formulation of the MIP. The superior performance of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated via numerical experiments.

AB  - This paper describes a modernization effort to a critical subsystem onboard NASA's Enhanced MODIS Airborne Simulator (eMAS). A new Blackbody Temperature Controller subsystem greatly improves eMAS' infrared-imaging calibration and offers substantial gains in measurement and control performance. Reductions in Size, Weight and Power (SWaP) over prior instrument hardware are also achieved. Real-time control from the ground via the NASA Airborne Science Sensor Net is enabled by the ARM-based, embedded controller. A linear-drive stage delivers 140W peak power to a Thermoelectric Cooler (TEC) array for the blackbody. The paper details the rationale for selection of a linear power stage and corresponding analyses and prototyping that traded PWM versus linear methods. Linear drive is often considered grossly inefficient; a deeper analysis and novel packaging techniques indicate otherwise for this specific application. A survey of high-performance, temperature-measurement techniques reveals that new System-on-Chip (SoC) offerings substantially reduce complexity over prior state-of-the-art with little compromise in performance. Packaging volume of the new technology also radically shrinks. Lab results indicate measurement readout-noise (15mK, 3σ) improvements over legacy eMAS hardware. Selection of the temperature sensor and NIST-traceable calibration yields an overall systematic error of 60mK typical, 141mK worst-case. A full measurement system error budget is presented. The measurement stability aids performance and tuning of the control algorithm, also discussed. Two controllers have been built and integrated into the instrument in preparation for the upcoming deployment season. The new development is best understood in the context of the eMAS whiskbroom imager, its infrared capability, and the implementation of its blackbody infrared references. The blackbodies are built using circular plates of copper, coated with a special, high-emissivity paint that appears diffuse at infrared wavelengths. A pair of references on either side of the spectrometer's field of view provides an in-system, two-point calibration every scan line. An array of TEC modules is sandwiched between each plate and a forced-air cooled heatsink. A single sensor is read out at high precision with room for a coarse, auxiliary channel. Historically, temperature readout and control of these references were performed with a system mounted far from the spectrometer optical bench. Low-level analog signals were sent over long (10') cables in close proximity to the TEC array's high-current drive. This rendered the temperature measurement highly susceptible to systematic noise. The legacy system also utilized an analog control loop that could not be tuned or modified over time. The new controller leverages modern embedded system techniques to radically shrink the packaging volume and enable real-time control. Low-noise methods and clever thermal management allow the controller to be placed in close proximity to the reference plate. The overall result is an improvement in performance, reduction in system volume, and a drop in weight. Aircraft managers always welcome a weight reduction for airborne sensors; however, the eMAS technicians tasked with repeatedly installing the system are the real beneficiaries. Overall, the modernization effort represents a major step forward for this unique NASA Airborne Science asset.

AB  - The traditional electrocardiogram (ECG) acquisition system is generally based on the Nyquist sampling theorem of the MCU acquisition system. The problems caused by this are complex computational processing and storage of data. This paper proposed an embedded ECG acquisition system via compressed sensing. The system uses a 32-bit embedded ARM processor combined with a compressed sensing algorithm to transmit the collected ECG signals to the computer after noise reduction and compression processing. Then reconstruct the ECG signals with different reconstruction algorithms. The experiment proves that the system has the characteristics of high precision, low power consumption and portable power saving.

AB  - Most consumer-grade digital cameras can only capture a limited range of luminance in real-world scenes due to sensor constraints. Besides, noise and quantization errors are often introduced in the imaging process. In order to obtain high dynamic range (HDR) images with excellent visual quality, the most common solution is to combine multiple images with different exposures. However, it is not always feasible to obtain multiple images of the same scene and most HDR reconstruction methods ignore the noise and quantization loss. In this work, we propose a novel learning-based approach using a spatially dynamic encoder-decoder network, HDRUNet, to learn an end-to-end mapping for single image HDR reconstruction with denoising and dequantization. The network consists of a UNet-style base network to make full use of the hierarchical multi-scale information, a condition network toperform pattern-specific modulation and a weighting network for selectively retaining information. Moreover, we propose a Tanh_L1 loss function to balance the impact of over-exposed values and well-exposed values on the network learning. Our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance in quantitative comparisons and visual quality. The proposed HDRUNet model won the second place in the single frame track of NITRE2021 High Dynamic Range Challenge. The code is available at https://github.com/chxy95/HDRUNet.

AB  - In-network data compression plays an important role in the elimination of redundant time-series data in a wireless sensor network (WSN). Inconsistency of data and high computational process in cluster formation remain to be challenging issues of in-network data compression particularly for energy-constraint WSNs. This paper develops a new data clustering technique for in-network data preprocessing and compression called Error-Control Truncated Singular Value Decomposition (ETSVD) to achieve online outlier detection and adaptive data compression. The ETSVD is divided into two modules which are Adaptive Recursive Outlier Detection and Smoothing (ARODS) and Adaptive Data Compression (DC). Firstly, the ARODS pre-processes the collected data for outlier detection and smoothing in order to improve the data quality. Secondly, the DC decomposes the pre-processed data into vector space to compress the spatio-temporal correlated data based on the predefined error threshold at the sending end. After the compression of correlated data, the distinct decomposed data are reconstructed at the receiver end which is performed offline. The simulation results show that the proposed technique is able to compress 91.49% of spatio-temporal environmental temperature data with reconstruction error having a minimum tolerance of $\pm 1.0^\circ $ C. The performance improvement of ETSVD in terms of error and accuracy compared to the performance of conventional SVD are 85.26% and 33.49%, respectively. Moreover, the ETSVD provides efficient error-control data preprocessing and compression solutions within the networks with minimum space and time complexities.

AB  - The adaptive data rate (ADR) algorithm is used in LoRaWAN, allocating an appropriate transmission rate for terminal equipment to improve channel utilization and reduce power consumption. However, the standard ADR algorithm is only suitable for static terminal equipment. In addition, due to the complexity of the external environment, the selected data rate will not match the new environment and communication packets will be lost. Therefore, this article proposed a novel and more effective ADR algorithm called new-dynamic ADR (ND-ADR). The algorithm mainly solves two problems, i.e., the standard ADR algorithm cannot be applied to mobile terminal devices and the poor communication quality and high packet loss rate in harsh environments. In this study, we also developed a frame for LoRaWAN (FLoRaWAN), a simulation framework for the star network topology LoRaWAN in OPNET. Furthermore, we built an OKUMURA–HATA model and additionally introduced a noise factor  $\beta$  to simulate the loss of wireless communication in harsh environments. Finally, extensive simulation results showed that the number of data packets required by different end nodes for rate allocation was different. Compared with the standard ADR algorithm, even for mobile nodes in harsh environments, the ND-ADR algorithm reduced network energy consumption by about 13%, reduced network delay by about 18%, and increased effective throughput by about 15%. Therefore, the improved ND-ADR algorithm is more suitable for wireless communication of removable nodes in harsh environments. Its advantages are better awareness of link environment, faster data rate regulation, improved channel utilization, and further reduction of network energy consumption.

AB  - Appropriate power control algorithm can increase total network rate and reduce energy consumption through optimizing signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) received by users. Thus it is vital for heterogeneous cellular networks, which are composed of macro base stations (BSs) and micro BSs. However, most existing power control schemes neglect the dynamic traffic variation and backhaul bandwidth constraint due to the variability of wireless traffic and difficulty of problem solving. This results in the performance reduction and resource waste under the highly dynamic traffic. In view of this, we propose an intelligent power control algorithm based on accurate traffic prediction. First, hybrid prediction scheme, composed of long short term memory (LSTM) and historical average value (HAV), is used to predict the traffic demand of each BS. Based on the predicted results, we propose a power control scheme. It achieves a weighted tradeoff between the total network rate and energy consumption under the consideration of backhaul constraint. By using the properties of concave function and the function structure of backhaul constraint, the Marks-Wright algorithm and difference of two convex functions (DC) programming are respectively employed to solve the non-convex optimization model approximately and accurately. Simulation results demonstrate that the prediction accuracy of proposed scheme is 3.73% and 6.03% higher than that of the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and support vector machine (SVM) algorithm, respectively. Compared with full power transmission, energy consumption of the proposed algorithm is reduced by 58.29%, while total network rate is increased by 3.26%.

AB  - In this paper, we propose a trajectory reconstruction method based on low-cost Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) in smartphones. The IMU used in our work consists of a three-axis accelerometer and a three-axis gyroscope, which can record information of acceleration and rotation, respectively. Since intrinsic bias and random noise usually cause unreliable IMU signals, filtering methods are utilized to reduce high- or low-frequency noises of the signals. In addition, to more accurately detect whether the smartphone is moving or not, we extract multiple features from IMU signals and train a movement detection model based on linear discriminant analysis (LDA). Then, a “reset switch” mechanism is applied when the smartphone is detected as in a static state. The “reset switch” mechanism can effectively restrain the accumulated error of displacement calculation. Finally, the trajectory reconstruction results are applied to handwritten letter recognition for English alphabet, and the experimental results show that our proposed trajectory reconstruction method is reliable.

AB  - In this investigation, we focus on the problem of mapping the ground reflectivity with multiple laser scanners mounted on mobile robots/vehicles. The problem originates because regions of the ground become populated with a varying number of reflectivity measurements, whose value depends on the observer and its corresponding perspective. Here, we propose a novel automatic, data-driven computational mapping framework specifically aimed at preserving edge sharpness in the map reconstruction process and that considers the sources of measurement variation. Our new formulation generates map-perspective gradients and applies sub-set selection fusion and de-noising operators to these through iterative algorithms that minimize an ℓ1 sparse regularized least squares formulation. The reconstruction of the ground reflectivity is then carried out based on Poisson's formulation posed as an ℓ2 term promoting consistency with the fused gradient of map-perspectives and a term that ensures equality constraints with reference measurement map data. We demonstrate that our new framework outperforms the capabilities of the existing ones with experiments realized on Ford's fleet of autonomous vehicles. For example, we show that we can achieve map enhancement (i.e., contrast enhancement), artifact removal, de-noising, and map-stitching without requiring an additional reflectivity adjustment to calibrate sensors to the specific mounting and robot/vehicle motion.

AB  - Smart traffic congestion reduction is useful for reducing the traffic in a highly congested area. To prevent heavy traffic Internet of things is implemented through a small device called a sensor, this technology is called smart traffic. A small device is placed near the roadside street post to detect the vehicle count. Smart traffic works by collecting the various signals like WiFi, Bluetooth, ZigBee from various electronic gadgets like a smartphone, smartwatch, smart band, tablet. The MAC address from each vehicle is collected as input information and stored in a cloud platform. Analyze and calculate the collected data set and performed it under machine learning prediction algorithms to get a better accuracy result to avoid traffic congestion. The logistic regression algorithm gives a 91% of accuracy level in traffic. It gives the shortest route to reach the destination without any hurdles. Results are reduced the traveling time, noise pollution, carbon dioxide emission, reach the destination on correct time and also save the fuel.

AB  - Filtering images using a guidance signal, a process called guided or joint image filtering, has been used in various tasks in computer vision and computational photography, particularly for noise reduction and joint upsampling. This uses an additional guidance signal as a structure prior, and transfers the structure of the guidance signal to an input image, restoring noisy or altered image structure. The main drawbacks of such a data-dependent framework are that it does not consider structural differences between guidance and input images, and that it is not robust to outliers. We propose a novel SD (for static/dynamic) filter to address these problems in a unified framework, and jointly leverage structural information from guidance and input images. Guided image filtering is formulated as a nonconvex optimization problem, which is solved by the majorize-minimization algorithm. The proposed algorithm converges quickly while guaranteeing a local minimum. The SD filter effectively controls the underlying image structure at different scales, and can handle a variety of types of data from different sensors. It is robust to outliers and other artifacts such as gradient reversal and global intensity shift, and has good edge-preserving smoothing properties. We demonstrate the flexibility and effectiveness of the proposed SD filter in a variety of applications, including depth upsampling, scale-space filtering, texture removal, flash/non-flash denoising, and RGB/NIR denoising.

AB  - The burgeoning networked computing devices create many distributed systems and generate new signals on a large scale. Many Internet of Things (IoT) applications, such as peer-to-peer streaming of multimedia data, crowdsourcing, and measurement by sensor networks, can be modeled as a form of big data. Processing massive data calls for new data structures and algorithms different from traditional ones designed for small-scale problems. For measurement from networked distributed systems, we consider an essential data format: signals on graphs. Due to limited computing resources, the sensor nodes in the distributed systems may outsource the computing tasks to third parties, such as cloud platforms, arising a severe concern on data privacy. A de-facto solution is to have third parties only process encrypted data. We propose a novel and efficient privacy-preserving secure outsourced computation protocol for denoising signals on the graph based on the information-theoretic secure multi-party computation (ITS-MPC). Denoising the data makes paths for further meaningful data processing. From experimenting with our algorithms in a testbed, the results indicate a better efficiency of our approach than a counterpart approach with computational security.

AB  - Chronic heart failure (CHF) is a worldwide disease that affects more than 26 million people in the developed world. Tracking complications such as cardiovascular failure patients could be used to act in a preventative manner, to improve early diagnosis, and to avoid the need for hospitalisation or even life threatening circumstances, thereby significantly enhancing the patient’s overall quality of life. The most current improvements in computer-aided, heart sound recognition technologies have been examined in this system, which has been in operation for the past decade. This research investigates approaches for detecting CHF based on the heart sounds produced by the patient. The perception of heart rate, as well as the relationship between heart sounds and cardiovascular disease, are important considerations. The basic techniques used in the processing and interpretation of cardiac signals seem to be de-noising, categorization, extraction, feature extraction, and classification, among others. Because of the emphasis on the usage of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms for analysing heart sounds, classic Machine-Learning (ML) technologies are merged with IoT end-to-end technologies, and both are integrated with a wide range of defined techniques. The primary goal of this study is to examine the many technologies that are comprised of the internet of things that are used to forecast heart attack disease and how they are used. It is the purpose of this study not only to explain the existing heart attack prediction, but also to address the aware and monitoring system for the patient who is likely to be suffering from cardiovascular illness. In this work, certain types of literature are reviewed and a survey on approaches for predicting heart attack occurrences in the future has been conducted.

AB  - The lunar hyperspectral remote sensing is one of the most important means to understand the physical properties and chemical constituents of lunar surface materials. Moon Mineral Mapper (M3) is currently the only hyperspectral image (HSI) data of Moon. However, due to the limitations of sensor manufacture and the impact of complex extraterrestrial environment, there are serious stripes on the M3 images, which do harm to subsequent identifications and analysis. In this paper, an effective destriping algorithm for lunar HSIs based on the intrinsic characteristics of the stripes on M3 is proposed. Experimental results demonstrate that our method shows an improvement in terms of visual perception and spectral fidelity.

AB  - In this paper, we introduce the attempts of our fusion methods during the first DIHARD challenge. To our knowledge, this is the first launch in speaker diarization domain which aims to evaluate the performance of the state-of-the-art system in realistic adverse acoustic environments. Besides speech preprocessing modules including speech denoising and speech activity detection, our attention has been focused on back-end clustering algorithms, especially in system fusion. Consensus clustering is adopt to combine both original speech and denoised speech, for purifying unreliable clusters. Moreover, a score-level fusion is conducted between GMM-UBM-based i-vector and CNN-based i-vector. Finally, our system achieves diarization error rates (DERs) of 36.05% on the evaluation sets, which is the second place in the DIHARD challenge.

AB  - Identification of the type of communication technology and/or modulation scheme based on detected radio signal are challenging problems encountered in a variety of applications including spectrum allocation and radio interference mitigation. They are rendered difficult due to a growing number of emitter types and varied effects of real-world channels upon the radio signal. Existing spectrum monitoring techniques are capable of acquiring massive amounts of radio and real-time spectrum data using compact sensors deployed in a variety of settings. However, state-of-the-art methods that use such data to classify emitter types and detect communication schemes struggle to achieve required levels of accuracy at a computational efficiency that would allow their implementation on low-cost computational platforms. In this paper, we present a learning framework based on an LSTM denoising auto-encoder designed to automatically extract stable and robust features from noisy radio signals, and infer modulation or technology type using the learned features. The algorithm utilizes a compact neural network architecture readily implemented on a low-cost computational platform while exceeding state-of-the-art accuracy. Results on realistic synthetic as well as over-the-air radio data demonstrate that the proposed framework reliably and efficiently classifies received radio signals, often demonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

AB  - Ongoing research in emission reduction requires accurate load detection for combustion engines with a limited number of sensors. Therefore, fast estimation of load temperature is essential. Temperature measurements are influenced by the thermal properties of the sensor itself as well as its position and mounting method. In this paper, the transient thermal behavior of the engine's crankcase and the temperature sensor for load detection is modeled as a low-pass transfer function. The unknown parameters of the transfer function are identified from experimental measurements. Maximum likelihood estimation and Kalman filtering are used to estimate the original temperature from disturbed measurements. Estimator performance is evaluated via simulations of randomized test scenarios in a Monte Carlo fashion. Influences of the model errors, the measurement noise and the estimation window-time are investigated.

AB  - This paper proposes cyclostationary feature detection (CFD) based spectrum sensor for cognitive radio technology that consumes lower hardware resources and delivers shorter sensing time. We have addressed the challenge of efficiently implementing complex frequency-domain based CFD spectrum-sensing algorithm. Specifically, VLSI-architecture of 2048-point FFT module has been multi-level resource shared for the optimization. In addition, performance analyses results of our spectrum sensor are presented for 1024, 2048 and 4096 point FFT sizes where the proposed design delivered adequate detection-probability of 0.9 at -5 dB of SNR. This spectrum sensor is FPGA implemented and it showed that the hardware utilization has been improved due to 100% reduction in memory requirement and has archived a shorter sensing time of 0.4 ms which is 12.5× lesser compared to the state-of-the-art work.

AB  - In the process of using space bearing, there are some problems such as the difficulty in identifying reliability characteristics, and the lack of fault diagnosis methods. Firstly, based on the reliability enhancement test principle, the temperature stress step test under standard atmospheric pressure and the vacuum degree step test at the use temperature are designed, and a space bearing test system that meets the control and measurement requirements is constructed. Then, after collection of the vibration response data under the condition of 0r/min and 1000r/min rotation speed, the wavelet energy spectrum of time-frequency data, which is the reliability characteristics, are identified using EEMD algorithm for data fusion and de-noising to study the fault state that reliability characteristics change with stress. Next, with the vibration response data of different running moments, data fusion de-noising and amplitude feature extraction are carried based on Hilbert transform. By obtaining the energy distribution of amplitude features in different frequency segments by fast Fourier transform, which is the reliability characteristic, the fault state of reliability characteristics over time is studied. Finally, through the simulation analysis, the mechanism and law of the corresponding fault state are identified, and the diagnostic relationship between the fault state and the simulation mechanism identified by the test is established, which can provide support to the on-orbit health monitoring and fault management.

AB  - In distributed wireless networks, the adaptation process depends on the information being shared between various nodes. The global minimum, is therefore, likely to be affected when the information shared between the nodes gets corrupted. This could happen due to several reasons namely link failure, noisy environment and erroneous data etc. In this research, we propose a computationally efficient robust incremental least mean square (RILMS) algorithm to resolve the aforementioned issues. Essentially, a fusion step is introduced in the framework of the incremental least mean square (ILMS). Prior to adaptation at a node, the information shared by the neighbouring node is fused with the temporally preceding information of the node using an efficient combiner. An adaptive fusion strategy is proposed resulting in dynamic weight assignment for the fusion step. Closed form expression for the steady-state excess mean square error (EMSE) is derived and the performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated for the noisy link environments and compared to the existing algorithms. Extensive experiments show the efficacy of the proposed approach compared to the contemporary methods. The proposed algorithm is found to be robust against the link failure and local node divergence problems. The improved performance of the proposed RILMS algorithm comes with a significant reduction in computational complexity compared to the convex combination based ILMS (CILMS) approach.

AB  - In this paper, we investigate dynamic channel se- lection in short-range Wireless Isochronous Real Time (WIRT) in-X subnetworks aimed at supporting fast closed-loop control with super-short communication cycle (below 0.1 ms) and extreme reliability (>99.999999%). We consider fully distributed approaches in which each subnetwork selects a channel group for transmission in order to guarantee the requirements based solely on its local sensing measurements without the possibility for exchange of information between subnetworks. We present three fully distributed schemes: $\epsilon$-greedy channel allocation, minimum SINR guarantee (minSINR) and Nearest Neighbor Conflict Avoidance (NNCA) based on measurements of the minimum SINR and interference power. We further apply a centralized graph coloring scheme as a baseline for evaluating performance of the proposed distributed algorithms. Performance evaluation considering subnetwork mobility and spatio-temporal correlated channel models shows that the dynamic allocation schemes results in significant performance improvement and a reduction in the bandwidth required for supporting such extreme connectivity by up to a factor larger than 2 relative to static channel assignment.

In the paper, the ECG based biometrics system is implemented for the connected health systems or Body Sensor Area Networks (BANs). The proposed approach is based on wavelet thresholding and Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition to minimize the effects of the presence of various noises and artifacts in signal. The implementation of the proposed algorithm is carried out on the Zynq SoC (Zybo Zynq-7000(xc7z010clg400) prototyping board) to validate the real-time performance of the system. The results are carried out on MITBIH Normal Sinus Rhythm Database. The feature extraction methods singular value decomposition and eigen decomposition of the proposed algorithm are implemented on FPGA. K Nearest Neighbour Classifier is used for identification purposes. The False Measure rates, i.e., FAR and FRR were found to be 2.35% and 1% respectively, which are better in comparison to previous work. The proposed system has excellent classification accuracy (99.5%) for ECG based authentication.

AB  - In this paper, we present a real-time quality-aware pulse waveform delineation and parameter extraction method for accurate and reliable measurements of pulse parameters from photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals. It consists of three major stages: the PPG signal quality assessment (PPG-SQA) using autocorrelation function (ACF) and number of threshold-crossings (NTC) features, the zero-frequency resonator (ZFR) based pulse onset and peak determination, and the pulse parameter extraction. The method is implemented on the Arduino Due with a 32-bit Atmel SAM3X8E ARM Cortex-M3 CPU, 512-kB flash memory, 96-kB SRAM, and 84-MHz clock speed. The method is evaluated on the recorded PPG signals and three standard PPG databases. The PPG-SQA algorithm achieves an average sensitivity (Se) = 98.62%, specificity (Sp) = 97.37%, and overall accuracy (OA) = 98.09%. The algorithm achieves an average Se = 99.88%, positive predictivity (Pp) = 99.89, Se = 99.82%, and Pp = 99.95%, respectively with the delineation errors (mean ± standard deviation) of 8.45 ± 9.39 ms and 0.23 ± 1.33 ms for finding onsets and peaks, respectively. The statistical analysis demonstrates that the parameter measurement errors are minimum for most of the pulse cycles. Results show that our quality-aware PPG analysis scheme can achieve a false alarm rate reduction (FARR) of 97.36% which outperforms the other existing SQA algorithms. It can lead to save transmission and processing energy from 8.33% to 95.63% and 8.33% to 59.77% for a duration from 5 to 60 s, respectively. The method has great potential for low-energy IoT and unsupervised health monitoring devices.

AB  - Compressed sensing is now regarded as an effective method for dimension reduction during signal acquisition. One significant, yet under-addressed issue regarding the transmission of compressively sensed images is how to compress and code measurements, the output of a compressed sensing sensor. As the spatially adjacent correlation in the measurement domain is weak, conventional encoding algorithms cannot be applied directly for measurements. In this paper, we propose the adjacent pixels based measurement coding system (APMC) to generate compressed image bit-streams. Firstly, an adjacent pixels based measurement matrix (APMM) is applied to embed the pixel-domain boundary information of each block to the measurement domain. By adopting APMM, the pixel-domain information can be efficiently used for measurement-domain intra prediction. Moreover, to avoid the interference of pixels that are far apart and achieve a high prediction accuracy, we employ boundary measurements of neighboring blocks as references for prediction. Finally, we propose a rate control algorithm to process the residuals between measurements and predictions, to generate a coded bit sequence for transmitting. Experimental results demonstrated superiority in rate-distortion performance and bandwidth costs in transmitting as compared to previous schemes. Compared to the state-of-the-art, this work achieves a 24% decrease in bitrate and a 1.68 dB increase in Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) on average.

AB  - Myoelectric pattern recognition is widely used to control upper limb prostheses. However, the non-stationary characteristics of electromyography (EMG) signals, caused by physiological changes (e.g. muscle fatigue) or non-physiological changes (e.g. the electrode- skin impedance), hinder the use of prostheses and deteriorate the performance of the myoelectric control system. In this paper, a set of robust features is proposed to be integrated with adaptive learning techniques in order to improve the myoelectric performance. Four types of features are proposed, namely the H, HI, AI, and AIH features. The H features correspond to the histogram-oriented gradient (HOG) algorithm of the High-Density surface Electromyography map (HD-sEMG map). On the other hand, the HI features are generated by combining the H features and the intensity feature that is evaluated from the HD-sEMG map. AI is the intensity features calculated from the segmented HD-sEMG maps constructed in the individual channel. Finally, AIH features are obtained by combining the H features and AI features. Offline and online adaptive tests are conducted to evaluate the proposed features. The results show that employing the proposed AI features with an adaptive classifier improves the classification accuracy from 91.58% to 97.2% in online classification setups. Results also show that the AI features are more robust against noise than TD features. The average classification accuracy is reduced by 0.7% when additive White Gaussian noise is applied, in comparison to 5.8% reduction in accuracy when TD features is used. The results confirm the robustness of the proposed features extracted from the HD-sEMG map.

AB  - Ampacity is defined as the maximum current carrying capacity of an electrical conductor without compromising its physical integrity. A possible methodology for the monitoring of this parameter in transmission lines consists in the distribution of punctual temperature sensors along the line. This paper presents the development of electronic instrumentation for a current and temperature monitoring equipment to be applied in 230 kV power transmission lines. The chosen current transducer is the Rogowski Coil because of its linear response and decoupling between the measurement and power circuits, while the chosen temperature transducer is the NTC (Negative Temperature Coefficient) thermistor because of its low cost and high sensitivity. The developed prototype dos not use batteries or solar panels as power supply, as it is energized by the voltage induced in a secondary coil coupled to the transmission line. In order to increase the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and ensure electromagnetic compatibility (EMC), the hardware was developed and validated through numeric simulations and experimental measurements. Furthermore, digital noise reduction techniques such as oversampling and waveform averaging algorithms were implemented in the system. The developed equipment is theoretically able to measure electrical currents up to 1650 A, and was validated for currents up to 500 A and temperatures up to 90 °C. All collected data is transmitted to a computer for further analysis via wireless communication.

AB  - This paper elucidates a model for acoustic single and multi-tone classification in resource constrained edge devices. The proposed model is of State-of-the-art Fast Accurate Stable Tiny Gated Recurrent Neural Network. This model has resulted in improved performance metrics and lower size compared to previous hypothesized methods by using lesser parameters with higher efficiency and employment of a noise reduction algorithm. The model is implemented as an acoustic Al module, focused for the application of sound identification, localization, and deployment on Al systems like that of an autonomous car. Further, the inclusion of localization techniques carries the potential of adding a new dimension to the multi-tone classifiers present in autonomous vehicles, as its demand increases in urban cities and developing countries in the future.

AB  - Range detection is the key to solve localization, tracking, navigation and other applications. Several solutions, such as LIDAR range sensor, is commonly used to achieve range detection. Considering that the microwave Doppler radar has the advantages of being unaffected by humidity, temperature and light variation, so it is more suitable for complex environment. The paper proposed a Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) Doppler radar system to perform short range detection of the target. Several methods were considered to extract the range information. According to the principle of FMCW radar, beat signal can be analyzed. Due to the complexity of the working environment, the beat signal contains various noise jamming. In order to eliminate noise contained in the beat signal, wavelet denoising method with the adapted threshold function was considered. In the frequency domain analysis, traditional FFT causes fence effects. FFT and CZT joint algorithm is proposed to suppress the influence of fence effects and improves real-time performance. The experimental results based on above methods are included in the paper.

AB  - In this paper, we consider learning based regularization for compressive sensing reconstruction using focal plane array sensors. While many optimization algorithms employ proximal operators for regularization, they are often inadequate in fully capturing the characteristics of complex natural images. Recently, deep learning based approaches obtained promising results in different imaging problems, creating the possibility to use them for regularization in an optimization framework. Here, we utilize this approach in compressive sensing based spatial multiplexing cameras. This technique is motivated by the high cost of producing large focal plane arrays in infrared sensors. Reconstruction from undersampled measurements can be done using a spatial multiplexing camera which relies on multiple snapshots for super-resolving a scene. It acquires coded projections of a scene using a spatial light modulator and a low-resolution focal plane array. We first formulate the problem of finding a high resolution image from its undersampled measurements. Then, we develop a reconstruction method with learning based regularization to solve this problem using alternating direction method of multipliers framework. For this, we replace the proximal operator corresponding to the regularization function with a deep convolutional denoising network. We also enhance a previously proposed denoising network's training phase by introducing multiple noise realizations for each training patch, which results in better reconstruction performance. Numerical results for different imaging scenarios show successful recovery of high resolution images in terms of PSNR, SSIM and visual quality at significant noise levels.
