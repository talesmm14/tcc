AB  - Recently, distributed optical fiber acoustic sensing (DAS) is regarded as a transformative technology in seismic exploration. However, both various complex background noise and weak desired signals significantly limit its practical application. To explore an effective denoising method for the vertical seismic profile (VSP) record received by DAS, we propose an improved residual encoder–decoder deep neural network (RED-Net) enhanced by deep iterative memory block (DMB) and channel aggregation block (CAB), called residual channel aggregation encoder–decoder network (RCEN). Here, DMB uses the weight accumulation theory to improve the feature extraction ability and achieve accurate noise elimination. Meanwhile, CAB, using the multi-channel analysis architecture, enhances the weak signal retention performance. In addition, we leverage both the synthetic data obtained by forward modeling and real DAS noise data to construct a sufficient training dataset with high authenticity, thereby meeting the requirement of network training. Both the synthetic and field DAS-VSP data processing results demonstrate the advantage of RCEN compared with competing algorithms, including singular value decomposition (SVD), conventional RED-Net, and feed-forward denoising convolutional neural network (DnCNN).

AB  - Monitoring Health parameters like Heart Rate (HR), Blood Pressure (BP), Oxygen level in blood (SpO2) etc., is demanding in recent times that has led to many wearable devices. HR is estimated from Photoplethysmography (PPG) signal using PPG sensors. The HR estimation during physical exercise is challenging because of the presence of Motion Artifacts (MA). A novel de-noising algorithm that reduces MA present in PPG signal is proposed. In this proposed de-noising algorithm, the combination of Normalized Least Mean Square (NLMS) and Recursive Least Squares (RLS) adaptive filters are used. The PPG signal de-noised by NLMS and RLS adaptive filters are combined together by means of convex combination. The HR is estimated in the frequency domain by taking the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of the de-noised signal. The performance of this technique is evaluated using the IEEE Signal Processing cup 2015 dataset. The HR estimation is improved by using the proposed de-noising algorithm and an error of 0.96 beats per minute (BPM) is achieved.

AB  - The localized faults of rotating machinery can be diagnosed by the extraction of the periodic transient impulses (PTIs); however, the PTI is generally weak and may get submerged in strong noise. To address this issue, a novel approach based on nonconvex sparse regularization denoising and adaptive sparse decomposition is proposed. The main work can be divided into two areas: 1) raw signal denoising and 2) repetitive impulses isolation. Specifically, for the raw signal denoising, the augmented Huber function is proposed as penalty function, and the convexity of the objective cost function (OCF) can be maintained; meanwhile, the solution of the proposed OCF can be solved using forward-backward splitting algorithm. For the repetitive impulses isolation, due to the commonly used resonance-based signal sparse decomposition (RSSD) method lacks adaptability and flexibility in practical application, the genetic algorithm (GA) is introduced to optimize the decomposition parameters of the RSSD that are selected adaptively in the desirable range according to the denoised signal in terms of the global optimization characteristic of GA. As an example, a pinion gear with weak root-crack failure is investigated based on the proposed approach. Compared to some state-of-the-art methods such as L1-norm fused lasso optimization (LFLO) and maximum correlated kurtosis deconvolution method, the results demonstrate that the proposed approach can effectively extract the weak fault frequency and its harmonics, and the shortcoming of the systematic underestimation of LFLO method has also been greatly improved.

A convolutional neural network (CNN) based machine learning approach is presented. State of art noise suppression methods are also discussed and used as benchmark against the proposed machine learning approach. The results of numerous simulated scenarios as well as actual sensor measurement campaigns are presented and discussed. Several metrics are derived to quantify the quality of the signal and give an indication of the performance of the different approaches of noise suppression. These derived metrics assess the performance of the different approaches in terms of amount of noise suppressed and amount of distortion introduced to the signal of interest.

AB  - Inertial sensor errors are an important error source in strapdown inertial navigation systems (SINS). These errors are divided into two groups: systematic and random. Systematic errors include offset and scale factor errors, which are estimated using special calibration methods. Random errors, however, can lead to instability of the offset or scale factor over time, which is a key component leading to the increase in SINS errors over time. In this paper we consider a method for reducing random noise in an inertial gyroscope signal using a hybrid deep recurrent neural network consisting of subnets: long short-term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent units (GRU). One of the most important tasks of constructing an adequate deep neural network structure is finding optimal network hyperparameters, which is solved in this work using the Bayesian optimization method. The obtained results are of great importance for solving the problem of the initial SINS alignment.

AB  - Effective signal denoising methods are essential for science and engineering. In general, denoising algorithms may be either linear or non-linear. Most of the linear ones are unable to remove the noise from the real-world measurements. More suitable methods are usually based on non-linear approaches. One of the possible algorithms to signal denoising is based on empirical mode decomposition. The typical approach to the empirical mode decomposition-based signal denoising is the partial reconstruction. More recently, a new concept inspired by the wavelet thresholding principle was proposed. The method is named the interval thresholding. In this article, we further extend the concept by the application of the sparse reconstruction to the empirical mode decomposition-based signal denoising algorithm. To this end, we state and then solve the problem of signal denoising as a regularization problem. In the article, we consider three cases, that is, three types of penalty functions. The first algorithm is combining total variation denoising with empirical mode decomposition approach. In the second one, we applied the fused LASSO Signal Approximator to design the empirical mode decomposition-based signal denoising algorithm. The third approach solves the denoising problem by applying a non-convex sparse regularization. The proposed algorithms were validated on synthetic and real-world signals. We found that the proposed methods have the ability to improve the accuracy of the signal denoising in comparison to the reference methods. Significant improvements from both the synthetic and the real-world signals were obtained for the algorithm based on non-convex sparse regularization. The presented results show that the proposed approach to signal denoising based on empirical mode decomposition algorithm and sparse regularization gives a great improvement of accuracy, and it is the promising direction of future research.

AB  - Fetal magnetoencephalography (fMEG) is a method to record human fetal brain signals in pregnant mothers. Nevertheless the amplitude of the fetal brain signal is very small and the fetal brain signal is overlaid by interfering signals mainly caused by maternal and fetal heart activity. Several methods are used to attenuate the interfering signals for the extraction of the fetal brain signal. However currently used methods are often affected by a reduction of the fetal brain signal or redistribution of the fetal brain signal. To overcome this limitation we developed a new fully automated procedure for removal of heart activity (FAUNA) based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Ridge Regression. We compared the results with an orthogonal projection (OP) algorithm which is widely used in fetal research. The analysis was performed on simulated data sets containing spontaneous and averaged brain activity. The new analysis was able to extract fetal brain signals with an increased signal to noise ratio and without redistribution of activity across sensors compared to OP. The attenuation of interfering heart signals in fMEG data was significantly improved by FAUNA and supports fully automated evaluation of fetal brain signal.

AB  - Multimodal learning has been proven to be an effective method to improve speech enhancement (SE) performance, especially in challenging situations such as low signal-to-noise ratios, speech noise, or unseen noise types. In previous studies, several types of auxiliary data have been used to construct multimodal SE systems, such as lip images, electropalatography, or electromagnetic midsagittal articulography. In this paper, we propose a novel EMGSE framework for multimodal SE, which integrates audio and facial electromyography (EMG) signals. Facial EMG is a biological signal containing articulatory movement information, which can be measured in a non-invasive way. Experimental results show that the proposed EMGSE system can achieve better performance than the audio-only SE system. The benefits of fusing EMG signals with acoustic signals for SE are notable under challenging circumstances. Furthermore, this study reveals that cheek EMG is sufficient for SE.

AB  - In recent years, the development of multi-sensor has emphasized the need to directly process multi-channel (multivariate) data. In this paper, a novel multivariate synchrosqueezing wavelet transform denoising method combined with subspace projection (SWT-SP) is proposed. One of the key points of this method is to obtain an optimal orthogonal matrix which can project a multivariate observation signal to a signal subspace occupied by a clean signal and an orthogonal noise subspace occupied by noise. Furthermore, the high dimensional time-frequency representation based on the synchrosqueezing transform realizes the multichannel signal information fusion, and the subspace projection makes full use of the spatial diversity characteristics of the observed signal. Finally, signal energy produces the aggregation effect in the former dimension space, which improves the signal-to-noise ratio(SNR) of signals in the signal subspace. The performance of this algorithm for standard multichannel denoising is verified on both real-world data and synthetic signals. The reconstructed signal obtained the improvement of the highest SNR by about 6 dB under different conditions.

AB  - This paper presents E-Nose, a novel cost-effective, field-deployable portable system that constitutes a 4-channel signal conditioning circuit and multi-coated piezo-resistive micro-cantilever sensors for explosive sensing. E-Nose also features an embedded PCA and K-means based pattern recognition (PR) algorithm for the classification of explosives from non-explosives. The 4-channel configuration is a stack of two 2-channel circuits that are capable of measuring the change in the sensor resistance or capacitance in four optional modes of ΔR-Δ R,ΔR-ΔC,Δ C-ΔR, and ΔC-ΔC by using time multiplexing. The circuit uses a bidirectional AC current excitation method to drive the sensor bridge for significant reduction of DC offset errors, 1/f noise, line noise, and DC drifts. The proposed signal conditioning circuit uses the phase-sensitive synchronous rectification(PSSR) method for AC-to-DC conversion by using balanced demodulation. The circuit can measure a wide range of resistors that range from 100 Ω to 4 MΩ, with a sensitivity of 0.4mV/ppm and the worst relative error of 2.6%. The capacitive measurement range is from 100pF to 100 μF with the worst relative error of 3.3%. The entire data processing and the PR algorithms run on Raspberry Pi (R-Pi), which is integrated into the E-Nose system. The system performance is tested with MEMS cantilevers for the detection of explosive compounds, such as TNT and its derivatives, RDX and PETN in a controlled environment at a concentration that was as low as 16ppb TNT, 56ppb RDX and 134ppb of PETN. Measurements show that the E-Nose can detect explosives with 77% as true positive results without considering the environmental and mixed vapor effects.

AB  - The variation of geomagnetic field greatly increases the difficulty of magnetic anomaly detection. This paper propose an improved adaptive coherent noise suppression(ACNS) method, which provides an effective denoising method for magnetic anomaly detection. Firstly, the signal of three-axis fluxgate sensor and their total magnetic field signal are denoised by the ACNS method, secondly, the four groups of signal above are summed by the adaptive weighted summation method, and then we use OBF algorithm to get the energy of the signal, achieve the goal of magnetic anomaly detection. Finally, the experimental results show that the improved method in this paper has better denoising effect than the original method, and the magnetic anomaly can be detected better by OBF algorithm after using the improved ACNS algorithm.

AB  - Objective: Noise reduction algorithms in current hearing devices lack informationabout the sound source a user attends to when multiple sources are present. To resolve this issue, they can be complemented with auditory attention decoding (AAD) algorithms, which decode the attention using electroencephalography (EEG) sensors. State-of-the-art AAD algorithms employ a stimulus reconstruction approach, in which the envelope of the attended source is reconstructed from the EEG and correlated with the envelopes of the individual sources. This approach, however, performs poorly on short signal segments, whilelonger segments yield impractically long detection delays when the user switches attention. Methods: We propose decoding the directional focus of attention using filterbank common spatial pattern filters (FB-CSP) as an alternative AAD paradigm, whichdoes not require access to the clean source envelopes. Results: The proposed FB-CSP approach outperforms both the stimulus reconstruction approach on short signal segments, as well as a convolutional neural network approach on the same task. We achieve a high accuracy (80% for 1 s windows and 70% for quasi-instantaneous decisions), which is sufficient to reach minimal expected switch durations below 4 s. We also demonstrate that the decoder can adapt to unlabeled data from anunseen subject and works with only a subset of EEG channels located around the ear to emulate a wearable EEG setup. Conclusion: The proposed FB-CSP method provides fast and accurate decoding of the directional focus of auditory attention. Significance: The high accuracy on very short data segments is a major step forward towards practical neuro-steered hearing devices.

AB  - Deep Learning (DL) models have been used extensively in image processing and other domains with great success but only very recently have been used in processing electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. Effective and powerful methods for denoising real ECG signals are important for wearable sensors and devices. This paper presents the design of a DL model, the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), together with the more conventional filtering methods (low pass filtering, high pass filtering, Notch filtering) and the standard wavelet-based technique for denoising ECG signals. This combination shows to produce better results than using only the CNN models. The methods are trained, tested and evaluated on real ECG datasets taken from the MIT PhysioNet database. The results show the CNN model is a performant model that can be used for denoising ECG signals, and also that before applying the CNN model, standard filtering of the original ECG signal has a beneficial effect for the final results. All CNN models used an NVIDIA TITAN V Graphical Processing Unit (GPU) with 12 GB RAM, which reduces drastically the computational times.

AB  - During the acquisition of the speech signal by the non-contact Speech Sensor (SS), the signal is degraded by severe colored noises which are non-linear and non-uniform in nature. Therefore, in this study, a new approach for advancing the speech enhancement technique is proposed to suppress these noises from the acquired speech signal. This technique is based on the adaptive thresholding, which uses Mean Median Deviation (MMD) method to determine adaptive threshold points, and Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) method. This algorithm has been validated by simulation data, and results of the proposed algorithm have been compared with other existing enhancement algorithms. Spectrograms and Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) comparison are used to analyze the quality of the enhanced speech signal. From the results, we demonstrate that the proposed algorithm offers better speech enhancement than previously existing speech enhancement techniques.

AB  - Noises from the measurement sensors are inevitable in radar cross Section testing due to the thermal agitation of electrons in imperfect conductors. Existing methods represented by wavelet threshold usually regard the measured data as a stationary stochastic signal, ignoring the inherent influence of the target under test, which inevitably removes the signal’s component when noise increases. This paper proposes a novel perspective on 2-D radar cross Section measurement denoising, considering the target’s inherent scattering characteristics (ISC). In the proposed method, the noise and the target are firstly separated as far as possible in the generalized Fourier series domain while the target’s component is all preserved. Then, the noise is further suppressed by the scattered field reconstruction of the Hankel function. Finally, a metal sphere being a calibrator is introduced to improve the denoising ability. Both simulations and experimental studies demonstrate the superiority of our method compared with existing algorithms. Results indicate that the proposed method can achieve higher accuracy.

AB  - The delay-and-sum (DAS) algorithm is widely used for beamforming in linear array photoacoustic (PA) imaging systems and is characterized by fast execution. However, these algorithms suffer from various drawbacks, such as low resolution, low contrast, high sidelobe artifacts, and lack of visual coherence. More recently, adaptive weighting was introduced to improve the reconstruction image quality. Unfortunately, the existing state-of-the-art adaptive beamforming algorithms are computationally expensive and do not consider the specific noise characteristics of the acquired ultrasonic signal. In this article, we present a new adaptive weighting factor named the variational coherence factor (VCF), which takes into account the noise level variations of radio frequency data. The proposed technique provides superior results in terms of image resolution, sidelobe reduction, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and contrast level improvement. The quantitative results of the microsphere phantom imaging show that the proposed VCF-assisted DAS method leads to 55% and 25% improvements in full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) and 57% and 32% improvement in SNR, respectively, compared to the state-of-the-art DAS-based methods. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively improve the reconstructed image quality and deliver satisfactory imaging performance even with a limited number of sensor elements. The proposed method can potentially reduce the instrumentation cost of the PA imaging system and contribute toward the clinical translation of the modality.

AB  - Human bowel sounds (BSs) convey valuable information on gastrointestinal health. Recently, the application of wearable healthcare systems has made it possible to monitor long-term human BSs. However, for the sake of protecting user privacy and reducing the data transmission volume, it is necessary to conduct coarse-grained BS sifting at the wearable sensor sides. In this brief, an edge BS recognition algorithm is proposed, which aims to pick the resting-state BS events and effectively reject the sound segments which contain only the background noises such as the speech and white Gaussian noise (WGN). The algorithm is highlighted with a time-domain histogram feature and a binarized CNN that is uniquely optimized for BS recognition. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm reaches 99.92% classification accuracy with a very low false alarm rate. Moreover, the algorithm is validated by hardware implementation and the computation overhead reduction ratio reaches 58.28 in terms of overall operations, in comparison with similar works in literature. These advantages indicate that our algorithm is suitable to be deployed on those edge devices with limited resources.

AB  - The idea behind this paper was stimulated by known of the theory of automatic control definition concern potential pulse characteristics. It is used for increase of metrological accuracy of the distributed temperature sensor. All known works used averaging of the pulse response or its processing on certain algorithms for reduction of an error of transformation. It is bad idealization of used pulse signals for simplification of calculations. Thus it is supposed by default that risetime and decrease of pulse top do not influence to accuracy. The given approach does not consider an error due the transitive characteristic for any signal transferred through system with finite number of elements. It is shown that in actual life it mismatches the validity. A new distributed temperature sensor structure with the characteristics nearly to so-called potentially achievable is proposed. It is offered to use the mathematical theory of potentially achievable pulse characteristics for definition of limitations of accuracy of the pulse converter. Thus our approach is a refusal of signal idealization otherwise use the constructive methods of approximation. The new approach allows to consider transient parameters: the risetime duration, cut-off, deadtime, and peak overshoot. In turn, it minimized an error related with methods of temperature calculation. For modeling the reflected signal is presented in the form of Lanne polynomials. The second polynomial Remez algorithm has been used for finding of peak overshoot. Finally, in the paper the operation principle of distributed temperature sensor is resulted. The methods related decreasing of noise influence to measurement are designated. Some practical advice on increase accuracy of measurement by distributed temperature sensor is given.

AB  - Summary form only given. Compressed sensing-based CMOS image sensor (CS-CIS) has gained significant interest in the past few years. It can greatly reduce on-chip processor complexity, transmission cost, and storage requirement compared to conventional sampling method using Nyquist-Shannon rate. CS-CIS performs acquisition and compression simultaneously and transfers all heavy computation burden components to decoder, where the measurement streams can be processed and analyzed with unlimited resources, resulting in a low-complexity encoder. Thus, it is very suitable for transmitting only applications, where computational resource and power is limited. However, spatial and temporal redundancy in measurement has become a primary concern which it is necessary to further compress. In this paper, we proposed temporal redundancy reduction in compressive video sensing by using moving detection and inter-coding. Firstly, the moving detection is performed coding area extraction using local adaptive threshold to classify the measurement with an association of error distinction. However, false-positive detection could be occurred randomly, which transmission cost can be increasing uncertainty. To reduce transmission costs, the adaptive quantization parameters are adjusted by how frequently the area is detected. Moreover, we further compress the detected area by encoding the difference of current measurement and the best-matched measurement in neighboring frames. Finally, an efficient recovery algorithm of sparse signal is performed by using -minimization via primal-dual interior-point algorithm and reconstructed by inverse fast Walsh-Hadamard transform with horizontal kernel filter to prevent staircase artifacts simultaneously. The experimental results show that our proposed can greatly reduce bandwidth usage in terms of BPP by 63.15%, improve in PSNR by 1.56dB, and SSIM by 14.81% on average when compared to the state-of-the-art works.

AB  - This paper proposes a reliable fault detection model for a pressure vessel under low pressure conditions. To improve the diagnostic performance, signals of different vessel health conditions are purified by eliminating noise so that signals of different categories are much more distinguishable. This de-noising technique uses a blind source separation (BSS) technique in which an initial noise-contaminated signal is separated into constituent sources. These individual sources are either device status-characterizing signal sources or interfering sources. Noise is removed and an unimpaired signal is regenerated from the characteristic sources. An abundant pool of heterogenous features are extracted from a refined signal to avoid omitting important fault-related properties. However, some of these fault features may be redundant and irrelevant, and they are likely to cause classification performance degradation. To choose the most discriminative fault-signatures from a plentiful feature set as well as reduce the dimensions of the feature input, this study proposes a new feature selection algorithm that associates a genetic algorithm (GA)-based discriminative feature analysis to a k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) classifier. The efficacy of involved techniques and the overall fault diagnostic model is examined in terms of visual and qualitative evaluations. Experimental results illustrated in this study justify that the proposed fault detection model is promising and outstanding compared to other state-of-the-art counterparts.

AB  - Graph Signal Processing (GSP) leverages pair-wise relationship between nodes of a graph to formulate operators on signals defined over the nodes. Most existing graph signal operators in the literature are linear, and can be described by linear transformation matrices. Recently, works are emerging that consider the time correlation of graph signals, leading to time-vertex signal processing. By exploiting the joint correlations across the graph topology and time, better results can be obtained. In this brief, we propose a median operator that will leverage the joint correlation, for denoising time-varying graph signals. The median operator, known for its robustness to outliers in statistics, has been very successful in traditional signal processing, especially for images. The efficient and highly localised graph median filters developed here are applied to denoising real world sensor network data. Real world sensor nodes are usually resource limited in terms of their computational and communication capacity, hence the imperative requirement for efficient localised filters. Comprehensive experimental results will show that in some cases, the performance is significantly better than the equivalent linear operator counterpart.

AB  - In this article, we discuss a novel signal processing technique for adaptive radar that permits joint target-matched illumination and interference avoidance in dynamic spectral environments. This approach allows for spectral coexistence between a radar system and a primary user of the radio frequency space. Spectral coexistence is exploited to allow the use of higher bandwidths than would otherwise be available to conventional radar systems. The technique proposed exploits the relative simplicity of the error reduction algorithm, and also provides a novel use of the masking procedure to allow for target-matched illumination. Practical constraints such as constant modulus are considered in the waveform design procedure, while providing an implied signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio improvement via the error reduction algorithm. Results for full simulation and hardware-in-the-loop experiments are presented and analyzed. We are able to show a signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio gain of 40 dB is achieved for the target-matched waveform as compared with a linear frequency modulated waveform. However, the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio gain comes at a cost of degraded autocorrelation characteristics of the target-matched illumination waveform, despite only modest levels of primary user spectrum occupancy. Spectral notch depths achieved by the modified error reduction algorithm are approximately 25 dB.

AB  - Intelligent fault diagnosis of bearings has been a heated research topic in the prognosis and health management of rotary machinery systems, due to the increasing amount of available data collected by sensors. This has given rise to more and more business desire to apply data-driven methods for health monitoring of machines. In recent years, various deep learning algorithms have been adapted to this field, including multi-layer perceptrons, autoencoders, convolutional neural networks, and so on. Among these methods, autoencoder is of particular interest for us because of its simple structure and its ability to learn useful features from data in an unsupervised fashion. Previous studies have exploited the use of autoencoders, such as denoising autoencoder, sparsity aotoencoder, and so on, either with one layer or with several layers stacked together, and they have achieved success to certain extent. In this paper, a bearing fault diagnosis method based on fully-connected winner-take-all autoencoder is proposed. The model explicitly imposes lifetime sparsity on the encoded features by keeping only k% largest activations of each neuron across all samples in a mini-batch. A soft voting method is implemented to aggregate prediction results of signal segments sliced by a sliding window to increase accuracy and stability. A simulated data set is generated by adding white Gaussian noise to original signals to test the diagnosis performance under noisy environment. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we compare our methods with some state-of-the-art bearing fault diagnosis methods. The experiments result show that, with a simple two-layer network, the proposed method is not only capable of diagnosing with high precision under normal conditions, but also has better robustness to noise than some deeper and more complex models.

The sensor is designed for 70 km sensing range using optical time domain reflectometry (OTDR) technique. We have compared the performance of designed sensor in terms of sensing resolution using different denoising algorithms such as dichotomize singular value decomposition (D-SVD) algorithm, Fourier-Wavelet Regularized Deconvolution (ForWaRD) algorithm and Lifting Wavelet algorithm. The temperature resolution is obtained as 11 K using D-SVD algorithm at 70 km distance. However, the temperature resolution as 29 K is observed without using denoising algorithm at same distance. An improvement of temperature resolution as 18 K is observed using D-SVD algorithm. In addition, the improvement of sensing resolution is observed in D-SVD algorithm compared to other denoising algorithms.

AB  - Signal acquisition from the wrist using wearable device is usually corrupted by noise, sometimes up to a level where the noise completely dominates the signal. In this paper, we use the acquisition of photoplethysmography (PPG) signal as an example to demonstrate our proposed algorithm implemented on a sensor array. To increase the chances of acquiring clean PPG signal, we develop a uniform linear sensor array located above the radial artery. We also develop a wearable device to integrate our sensor array and our proposed algorithm. We propose centralized state sensing (CSS), a centralized algorithm suited to our sensor array, to increase the efficiency in multi-sensor estimation. To support our proposed algorithm, we use heart rate estimation as an example and compare it with the estimation of a single sensor and the statistical mean of the estimation of multiple sensors. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposal achieve a reduction in mean absolute error of 26.8%, compared to the estimation result obtained using the average of the estimation of all sensors. Operating on a 80 MHz processor, our algorithm introduces a 8 ms overhead, making it highly suitable for wearable devices.

AB  - In this paper, we present a hybrid denoising algorithm dedicated to division-of-focal plane (DoFP) polarization images. The proposed algorithm, centered around the Block-Matching and 3D Filtering (BM3D) and K-times Singular Value Decomposition (KSVD) denoising algorithms, is capable of significantly enhancing the grouping step in the second round of collaborative filtering by purifying the “Semi-Filtered” image yielded by the first round of collaborative filtering. To achieve this, the BM3D denoising method's chain of operation is broken, and the “Semi-Filtered” image is passed through a round of KSVD denoising method before the second round of collaborative filtering is conducted. According to our extensive experimental results, the proposed algorithm visually outperforms the state-of-the-art BM3D denoising algorithm and a wide range of other denoising algorithms for DoFP polarization images. Quantitative results presented using Peak-Signal-to-Noise-Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) Index metrics further highlight the superior performance of the proposed algorithm.

AB  - The long-existing problem of high positioning inaccuracy by triangulation in the far region in short-range vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication environments is investigated in this study. The triangulation is achieved by sensing angle of arrival with two optical signal-direction sensors developed in our previous works. The measured signal-direction error can be categorized into two different kinds, namely systematic error and random error. The former is mainly incurred by imperfect calibration of hardware and misalignment of signal-direction sensors as well as multipath scattering of the signal. The latter is caused by random noises. Both of them lead to positioning error. By utilizing the specific characteristics pertaining to the triangulation measurements, it is possible to extract the target location and increase the accuracy with an optimization algorithm. With the aid of a general-purpose optimization subroutine together with two proper objective functions developed in this study, this work shows the viability of this idea. With the technique proposed in this paper, precise hardware calibration and careful alignment of signal-direction sensors are unnecessary. The problem of multipath scattering can also be mitigated. This work indicates a possible direction to treat the problem of high inaccuracy in noisy and ill-geometric environments in triangulation measurement. The abovementioned signal-direction sensors are currently constructed for infrared light. By changing the signal sources and detectors, they can also be fabricated for visible light. Such an alteration of transmission medium is beneficial for the currently emerging short-range visible-light intervehicular communications.

AB  - Image analysis has been used in a very large scale for different purposes. When an image is captured by a digital sensor, it is usually affected by some type of noise, even the smoothest ones. Therefore, image enhancement and denoising process are important tasks of digital image processing. This paper presents an algorithm to reduce non-stationary noise with the combination of a Low-Pass Filter (LPF) and a High-Pass Filter (HPF), in conjunction with an adaptive semantic model. To simulate the usefulness of such arrangement, a non-stationary Gaussian noise has been applied to an image, which has been splitted into the four quadrants, all of them having the same dimensions. In fact, such a noise with different intensities, has been added to the image in each of its quadrants. The Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) has been used to measure the best cutoff frequencies for both filters, as well as rules based on semantic concepts have been structured for decision making. Furthermore, for the validation of the algorithm we have taken into account the evaluation of the Mean Squared Error (MSE) using a typical digital image obtained from a crop of maize with the presence of the earwornm (Helicoverpa Zea). Besides, the denoising process demonstrates the efficiency and the satisfactory performance for the non-stationary noise filtering in agricultural images.

AB  - Partial discharge (PD) location techniques are a useful tool for condition monitoring of electrical apparatus in power systems. However, the noisy PD measurements may significantly degrade the performance of location algorithms. This paper deals with the PD location problem by using adaptive filtering techniques. Heretofore, scarce literature focuses on addressing the PD location based on such method. A novel adaptive algorithm, termed as total least-squares (TLS)-Matern kernel (TLS-MK), is proposed. Benefiting from the merits of the Matern kernel, the TLS model can effectively suppress the noise from the direct and reflected waves of the PD source. Meanwhile, the TLS-MK algorithm is used to estimate the time difference which is used in the PD location. Moreover, the convergence behavior of the TLS-MK algorithm is analyzed. Simulations and experiments show that the proposed algorithm can enhance the location accuracy as compared to state-of-the-art methods for various PD signals.

AB  - Raman-based distributed temperature sensing (RDTS) can achieve temperature measurement of tens of kilometers and is widely used in temperature monitoring of crucial facilities. The accuracy of RDTS is highly determined by the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the acquired spontaneous Raman scattering (SpRS) signals, which is about 60 dB weaker than the pump pulse. Therefore, the performance of single-mode fiber (SMF) based conventional RDTS is poor. To improve its performance, many methods have been proposed, including the use of special optical fibers, pulse coding techniques, and denoising algorithms. However, these methods have their limitations. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a deep 1-D denoising convolutional neural network (1DDCNN) to enhance the performance of RDTS. A simplified RDTS model is built to train and optimize the 1DDCNN. To verify the performance of the 1DDCNN on actual data, we experimentally measure the SpRS data of a 10-km SMF with an average time of 1 s and a spatial resolution of 3 m. The well-trained 1DDCNN reduces the temperature uncertainty from 6.4 °C to 0.7 °C with high fidelity. As a comparison, the commonly used wavelet denoising algorithm can only reduce it to 3.7 °C. Besides, the 1DDCNN does not require manual parameter adjustment and is not affected by the sampling rate, giving it significant advantages in practical applications compared with conventional denoising algorithms. Moreover, we believe that the proposed 1DDCNN can be applied to other distributed optical fiber sensing systems by fine-tuning the network with appropriate training data.

AB  - To filter out the phase noise of the Φ-OTDR system, a method based on empirical mode decomposition and Pearson correlation coefficient fusion (EMD-PCC) is proposed. First, the EMD-PCC method is simulated. The experimental results show that the SNR increases from 7.32 dB to 13.68 dB. Second, the beat signal detected by the Φ-OTDR system is demodulated by the I/Q quadrature demodulation method. Finally, the phase signal is decomposed by empirical mode decomposition to obtain the modal function and residual component. The Pearson correlation coefficient with the phase signal is calculated. Then, the threshold value is 0.4-1.0. The modal function within the threshold is superimposed with the residual component signal. In this paper, the experimental verification of PZT analog disturbance signal frequencies of 200 Hz, 300 Hz, 400 Hz and 500 Hz is performed. Then, wavelet denoising and EMD-soft denoising are compared with EMD-PCC denoising. Experimental results show that the proposed method can accurately restore the disturbance signal. The experiment of sawtooth disturbance signal frequencies of 400 Hz and 500 Hz verifies the applicability of the algorithm and shows that the method is suitable for other arbitrary forms of disturbance signals. The Φ-OTDR system has an important application in the field of oil and gas exploration. This method provides a good theoretical basis for the exploration field.

AB  - The issue of the low probability of intercept (LPI) radar signal sensing has received considerable attention. Furthermore, the development of military technology further increased demand for it in future electronic warfare (EW). Meanwhile, so far, a systematic understanding of how radar signal detection and recognition technology contributes to EW is still lacking. Therefore, this study aims to contribute to this growing area of research by exploring an automatic method for detecting and identifying radar signals based on visibility graphs (VG), which can extract more network and feature information in the two-dimensional space of VG. In this article, the signal to be measured is subjected to wavelet noise reduction. Secondly, auto-correlation processing is performed on the signal, we subsequently convert the signal into a VG complex network. Then the average degree and weighted operation of the network are used for signal detection and recognition, respectively. Experiments in the last part indicate that the proposed method provides excellent performance, such as the robustness to noise and the probability of classification, over several state-of-the-art algorithms.

AB  - This letter proposes a limited-memory receive filter design to maximize the output signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar. The associated problem is a minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) one which can be analytical solved, but the computation of the MVDR solution would be prohibitive in the context of massive MIMO radar, due to the huge memory consumption. To this end, we propose a low-complexity algorithm that exploits a reparameterization method to avoid the significant memory consumption, and solves the resulting problem with several simple algebraic operations. We show that the memory consumption of the proposed algorithm depends on the number of interference sources. Therefore, for the scenario with a large number of interference sources, we extend the proposed algorithm by the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), which promotes a further memory reduction. Finally, numerical simulations are conducted to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.

AB  - The time‐domain multichannel signal enhancement problem is an important generalization of the single‐channel case. This chapter explores different, although roughly equivalent, apparent avenues and derive many useful optimal filters for signal enhancement in a variety of contexts. Some important optimal filtering matrices are developed for multichannel noise reduction in the time domain. In order to unify these different algorithms, the chapter offers to use the joint diagonalization technique. It further shows how to exploit the spectrum of each one of the sensors' signals, and discusses the effect of the spatial information, which plays a critical role in multichannel signal enhancement when compared to the single‐channel case. Performance measures are an important area of the signal enhancement problem. Measures are derived related to the noise reduction. Finally, the chapter presents the MSE criterion, which is very convenient to use in signal enhancement applications.

AB  - We propose and experimentally demonstrate an on-chip optical sensor based on a dual-passband microwave photonic filter (MPF) incorporating a silicon photonic integrated microdisk resonator (MDR). Two whispering gallery modes supported by the MDR that are experiencing different wavelength shifts are employed for simultaneous temperature and refractive index (RI) measurements. To increase the interrogation speed and resolution, the MDR is incorporated in an MPF to produce two microwave passbands. By applying a broadband linearly chirped microwave waveform to the MPF, two filtered microwave waveforms with their temporal locations or equivalently central frequencies corresponding to the wavelength shifts of the notches are generated. The measurement of the temporal locations or equivalently the central frequencies is performed at high speed and high resolution using a digital signal processor. To increase the signal-to-noise ratio of the filtered microwave waveforms, a noise reduction algorithm based on phase-only filtering is proposed and employed. The on-chip optical sensing system is experimentally demonstrated. The sensing system can provide high temperature and RI interrogation resolutions of 2.4 × 10-5 °C and 9.1 × 10-8 RIU at a high interrogation speed of 1 MHz.

AB  - Denoising videos in real-time is critical in many applications, including robotics and medicine, where varying-light conditions, miniaturized sensors, and optics can substantially compromise image quality. This work proposes the first video denoising method based on a deep neural network that achieves state-of-the-art performance on dynamic scenes while running in real-time on VGA video resolution with no frame latency. The backbone of our method is a novel, remarkably simple, temporal network of cascaded blocks with forward block output propagation. We train our architecture with short, long, and global residual connections by minimizing the restoration loss of pairs of frames, leading to a more effective training across noise levels. It is robust to heavy noise following Poisson-Gaussian noise statistics. The algorithm is evaluated on RAW and RGB data. We propose a denoising algorithm that requires no future frames to denoise a current frame, reducing its latency considerably. The visual and quantitative results show that our algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance among efficient algorithms, achieving from two-fold to two-orders-of-magnitude speed-ups on standard benchmarks for video denoising.

In this letter, we present an integral-based orthogonal AMP (IB-OAMP) technique that avoids the requirements of AMP (and also the original form of OAMP) on differentiable and separable denoisers. The orthogonality in IB-OAMP can be established using a Monte Carlo method similar to the training stage in a machine-learning algorithm. These features make IB-OAMP attractive to be used in conjunction with some well-studied denoising algorithms.

AB  - In most optical fiber distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) systems, to obtain the desired outcome, the sensing signal acquired by DAS systems normally needs to be denoised. In some applications, such as the identifiation of the position of fast-moving targets, we need DAS systems to respond with sufficient speed. However, most classical denoising algorithms do not work if the signals are insufficiently collected within a short period (called a short-time signal). To obtain ideal results within a short time window, we propose an attention-based convolutional neural network (CNN) structure with extremely short signal windows to learn and approximate the results of classical denoising methods. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, the experiment is conducted under a real field highway scenario where the desired signals are overwhelmed with noise. The results show that by using signals collected within extremely short time windows of 100 ms, an insufficient time for the processing of existing denoising algorithms, our structure yields a satisfactory denoising performance.

AB  - As a novel asynchronous-driven cameras, event-based sensors are with high sensitivity, fast speed, low power consumption and low data volume, but with abundant noise. Since the output of event-based sensors is in the form of address-event-representation (AER), the traditional frame-based denoising method cannot be used. In this paper, we introduce a novel event stream denoising method for such sensors. Effective events tend to show temporal and spatial regularity, while noise events show a kind of randomness. Thus, we build a probabilistic undirected graph model to describe this difference, with which the denoising problem is converted to a probability maximization problem. Then, the model is decomposed into the product of the energy function on the maximum cliques, and the iterated condition model (ICM) is used for energy minimization to obtain the denoised event stream. Experiments show that our method can effectively remove noise events directly from the event stream and significantly improve event recognition rate.

AB  - This paper aims to use only one sensor to achieve better PD fault location of power cables in a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) noise environment. Therefore, an improved phase difference (IPD) method based on one sensor is used to estimate the PD fault location of power cables. This method has a good advantage of using only the first two PD peaks, which is suitable for location estimation in the low SNR noise environment. The white Gaussian noise is regarded as background noise to simulate the noise environment. In order to enhance the accuracy of the IPD method in the noisy environment, a new denoising algorithm combining high-order statistics (HOS) criterion and generalized cross-validation (GCV) thresholding is proposed to process PD signals. The results show the good performance of the proposed denoising algorithm and higher location accuracy of the IPD method in the low SNR noise environment.

AB  - In this letter, we propose a novel system for localization of a wireless sensor network using the localized Procrustes analysis with manifold learning. Due to different environmental factors, such as noise and fading, the internode distances calculated by the received signal strength indicator are erroneous and may not satisfy the L2 norm. The nodes seemingly lie on an unknown high-dimensional manifold that satisfies the Riemannian manifold assumption. Thus, the problem of localization is transformed into the problem of nonlinear dimensionality reduction. The location of the nodes can be learned through a manifold learning algorithm like Isomap. However, the coordinates so obtained needed to be transformed to obtain the correct locations of the nodes. We use the localized Procrustes analysis in order to align the relative locations to the absolute or global locations. The localized Procrustes analysis considers each sensor node's neighborhood and computes distinct parameters for each sensor based on the transformation parameters of the anchors present in its neighborhood. Experiment results show that our proposed system outperformed existing localization schemes and can localize the nodes with a better accuracy up to 31.27% in contrast to the least square optimization method.

AB  - In non-destructive testing and evaluation, the microwave-based synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging have shown great potential in the detection of defects on buried objects such as pipes. However, due to the pipe curvature and high stand-off distance when inspecting an insulated pipe, the useful defect information used to characterize the pipe image is lost as a result of low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), resulting in a blurred and unfocused image. In this paper, we proposed a robust microwave-based SAR imaging using autofocus range-Doppler algorithm (RDA) for the inspection of an insulated pipe. Singular value decomposition is used to mitigate the effect of the insulation layer by removing dominant singular values that characterize the insulation layer, and the autofocus RDA is designed to refocus the SAR image using RDA residual refocusing. The SNR, improvement factor (IF), and squared error are used to evaluate the qualitative image information of the defect on the pipe. Experimental results showed the efficacy of the method in detecting defects on an insulated pipe, in particular, a significant reduction in the noise content of the image compared to the known SAR Omega-k algorithm. It was found that the autofocus RDA gave higher values of SNR and IF (3 dB and 6 dB) compared to the Omega-k algorithm (-1 dB and 2 dB), respectively.

AB  - Image Signal Processor (ISP) comprises of various blocks to reconstruct image sensor raw data to final image consumed by human visual system or computer vision applications. Each block typically has many tuning parameters due to the complexity of the operation. These need to be hand tuned by Image Quality (IQ) experts, which takes considerable amount of time. In this paper, we present an automatic IQ tuning using nonlinear optimization and automatic reference generation algorithms. The proposed method can produce high quality IQ in minutes as compared with weeks of hand-tuned results by IQ experts. In addition, the proposed method can work with any algorithms without being aware of their specific implementation. It was found successful on multiple different processing blocks such as noise reduction, demosaic, and sharpening.

AB  - With the development of semiconductor technology, the performance of many new image sensors, such as infrared focal planes and CMOS image sensors, have been improved. Also, it is an alternative choice of CCD, vacuum tube or other equipment that promotes this kind of sensors to become the mainstream of the market. However, this kind of image sensors has a weakness that is the stripe noise, due to the inconsistent readout circuit response. This noise influences the quality of image directly, as a result, the poor image quality in-benefits for recognition and classification. Thus, how to remove the stripe noise arises the interests for many researchers. Most of them only focus on one certain type of stripe features, instead of combining different features together, leading to the poor performance of denoising. This paper proposes a method of removing stripes that combines feature extraction and function fitting. Firstly, extract the statistics and spatial position of the stripes, and then perform two steps of rough processing and fine processing on the image. The PSNR, SSM value show that the algorithm meets the design expectations and has a certain degree of robustness.

AB  - Ultra-high quality (Q) whispering gallery mode (WGM) optical microcavities have been shown to be sensitive biomolecular sensors due to their long photon confinement times. We have previously experimentally demonstrated that a system known as FLOWER (frequency locked optical whispering evanescent resonator) can detect single macromolecules. FLOWER uses frequency locking in combination with balanced detection and data processing to greatly improve the sensitivity, stabilization, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and the detection limit of ultra-high-Q microcavities. Here we present the analytical basis for FLOWER and explore its limits of detection via numerical simulation. We examine the effects of key parameters such as Q-factor and frequency modulation depth on the SNR of FLOWER. We demonstrate that the frequency locked optical microcavity system is limited by the shot noise from the receiver, as well as the laser intensity noise. Using median filtering in combination with step-fitting algorithms, frequency locked ultra-high-Q microcavities can detect resonance shifts as small as 0.05 attometers at one millisecond time intervals. Our results can guide the choice of experimental parameters to achieve better sensing performance in a variety of target applications, including fundamental studies of protein-protein interactions and medical diagnostics and prognostics.

AB  - We present a novel approach for recovering a sparse signal from quadratic measurements corresponding to a rank-one tensorization of the data vector. Such quadratic measurements, referred to as interferometric or cross-correlated data, naturally arise in many fields such as remote sensing, spectroscopy, holography and seismology. Compared to the sparse signal recovery problem that uses linear measurements, the unknown in this case is a matrix formed by the cross correlations of the sought signal. This creates a bottleneck for the inversion since the number of unknowns grows quadratically with the dimension of the signal. The main idea of the proposed approach is to reduce the dimensionality of the problem by recovering only the diagonal of the unknown matrix, whose dimension grows linearly with the size of the signal, and use an efficient Noise Collector to absorb the cross-correlated data that come from the off-diagonal elements of this matrix. These elements do not carry extra information about the support of the signal, but significantly contribute to these data. With this strategy, we recover the unknown matrix by solving a convex linear problem whose cost is similar to the one that uses linear measurements. Our theory shows that the proposed approach provides exact support recovery when the data is not too noisy, and that there are no false positives for any level of noise. It also demonstrates that the level of sparsity that can be recovered scales almost linearly with the number of data. The numerical experiments presented in the paper corroborate these findings.

AB  - Automated hearing test equipment is a kind of hearing testing system with good environmental adaptability, self-help hearing examination, which can be applied to most people in community. The environment noise is a major obstacle to the measurement accuracy of automated hearing test equipment. The active noise control technology can cancel the noise by generating the reverse sound wave equal to the external noise, so as to achieve the effect of noise reduction. In this paper, an automated hearing test system based on active noise control technology was developed. The designed system mainly included hardware board, noise detection sensor, touch screen, active noise control card, fitting instrument and power supply and the associated devices included earphone, hearing aids and printer. Active noise control technology is used to reducing the interference of environmental noise. A total of 95 volunteers were selected to receive the hearing examination by the automated hearing test system and pure-tone audiometer. The differences of hearing thresholds between automated hearing test system and pure-tone audiometer were less than 5 dB at all frequencies. The evaluation results show that this system provides a quick and convenient automated hearing test method, and can obtain a relatively reliable result.

AB  - Maximizing the achievable SNR benefits the measurement’s precision that is affected by thermal noise, and track precision is enhanced given precise, unbiased, range measurements. While the radar is tracking the kinematic state (i.e., position, velocity, and acceleration) of the target, optimal signal processing requires knowledge of the target’s signature, range rate, and radial acceleration. Increasing the SNR of individual measurements by enhanced signal processing results in reduced settling time for the track filter and less valuable radar resources required to achieve a specified track quality. Moving targets introduce range-walk (RW), which degrades coherent processing leading to a reduction in SNR and a blurring of the point target response in range-Doppler (RD), resulting in degraded range estimates to the Tracker. Traditional radar architectures require excessive iterations of the track loop with the associated measurements to achieve a specified track quality threshold. In this paper, the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, an iterative and inference approach, provides improved parameter estimation and SNR by employing a Kalman filter within the Signal Processor to account for changes in the target’s kinematics. The improved state estimates are used in the Signal Processor to achieved enhanced RW correction.

AB  - Modeling of the underlying noise in a hyperspectral image reveals important information about the characteristics of the hyperspectral sensor and the image itself. While the focus in the literature has mostly been on the estimation of noise statistics, it is also of interest to estimate the actual noise present in each pixel, which can not only directly contribute to denoising of the image but can also aid other image processing algorithms exploiting such information. In this letter, we propose a novel method for per-pixel noise estimation that is also able to deal with spectral correlation in the noise. The method makes no assumptions on the behavior of the underlying noise. Simulation results show that the proposed method performs significantly better than the existing methods in cases where there is a correlation in the noise.

AB  - Surgery navigation techniques aim to support surgeons during operations, resulting in improved accuracy and patient safety. In this context, electromagnetic tracking systems (EMTSs) are mainly used since they enable real-time tracking of small EM sensors included in surgical tools without line-of-sight restrictions. On the other hand, these systems are very sensible to magnetic field variations that can affect sensor position estimation performance. In this paper we analyze how magnetic field variations caused by the noise of transmitting coils' excitation currents affect system performance, and we propose a technique to reduce its undesirable effect. This method includes, in the position estimation algorithm, the measurement of excitation currents, thus compensating errors in sensor signal caused by current noise.Different simulation tests were performed to assess the proposed method which is based on modeling the magnetic field produced by the field generator (FG). Finally, it is validated by using experimental data provided by a novel EMTS prototype, obtaining noise peaks reduction and an overall mean position error of 3 mm at a distance of 600 mm from the FG.

AB  - An ultra-high precision magnetic field measurement is of great scientific and economic significance. An atomic magnetometer that operates in a spin-exchange relaxation-free (SERF) regime has superior sensitivity and, thus, is of great significance for the ultra-high precision magnetic field measurement. In order to reduce the noise of a SERF atomic magnetometer and further improve its sensitivity, a method for noise reduction based on the multigene genetic programming (MGGP) is presented. Different from the existing methods, in this method, the model of magnetometer noise is established based on the experimental data. Namely, the noise of the SERF atomic magnetometer is first modeled by the MGGP algorithm and then reduced by the obtained model. Besides, in this way, the sensitivity is improved. The experimental results indicate that our MGGP model can adequately reflect the characteristics of the SERF magnetometer noise. Moreover, after applying the proposed method, the sensitivity of the SERF magnetometer is improved about 13 times at 1 Hz, and there is also a significant sensitivity increase at the frequencies less than 10 Hz. Therefore, the proposed method can effectively reduce the noise and improve the sensitivity of the SERF magnetometer in the low-frequency band.

AB  - This paper proposes a new fetal monitoring system, including the acquisition and the processing of fetal heart sounds (FHS). Based on the foundation of the stethoscope principle, a single-channel, non-invasive sensor is designed to acquire the fetal heart sounds, in which polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane material is used as the core transducer. In the fetal heart sounds processing part, we propose a new method for denoising based on adaptive support vector regression (SVR) which has a good performance on curve fitting and effectively weakens the interference of additive noise. Thus, the clean fetal heart signals extracted from the interfered source can be further utilized to draw the fetal phonocardiogram (FPCG) and calculate the fetal heart rate (FHR).

AB  - The benefits and limitations inherent to the 2D postprocessing of measurements from Brillouin optical time-domain analyzers are investigated from a fundamental point of view. In a preliminary step, the impact of curve fitting on the precision of the estimated Brillouin frequency shift is analyzed, enabling a fair comparison between the representative noise-reduction algorithms studied in this article. The performances in terms of signal-to-noise ratio, experimental uncertainty σB on the Brillouin frequency shift and spatial resolution delivered by advanced image processing methods-such as wavelet transform and non-local means algorithms-are then compared with the impact of a 2D Gaussian filter. The major discrepancies observed when comparing the gain in signal-to-noise ratio to the σB reduction are then determined by exploiting the separability of the Gaussian filter, which reveals that noise reduction is only effective along 1-D of the 2D array of measurements and originates from a digital reduction of the system analog bandwidth. The signal-to-noise ratio improvement obtained from filtering in the spectral dimension is only illusory, since its action is redundant with the curve fitting procedure to estimate the Brillouin frequency shift. Finally, the maximum σB reduction achievable by digital post-processing is theoretically given, hence setting a fundamental limit to the improvement brought by data processing.

AB  - In recent years, many conventional image denoising techniques have been intensively studied to enhance the signal to noise ratio (SNR) of Brillouin optical time domain analyzer (BOTDA), due to their superior denoising performance to one-dimensional methods. However, in the case of low sampling rate, the details of the signal are smoothed out due to less useful information, resulting in a degradation of the spatial resolution. Moreover, these conventional denoising algorithms are quite time-consuming compared with the BOTDA measuring time. To overcome these drawbacks, we employ a feed-forward convolutional neural networks (CNN) based image denoising for BOTDA. A conventional BOTDA system with 15 ns pulse width is implemented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the exploited CNN-based denoising method. The actual electrical noise signals of the BOTDA at different sampling rates are collected to synthesize training samples. The CNN model is trained with the noise and simulated BOTDA signals. Experimental results show that SNR improvement of 13.43 dB, 13.57 dB, and 12.9 dB is achieved at a sampling rate of 500 MSa/s, 250 MSa/s, and 125 MSa/s, respectively, via the trained CNN denoiser. No spatial resolution distortion can be observed in the denoised BOTDA signals. Besides, the CNN denoiser only takes 0.045 s to process a 151 × 50000 image benefiting from GPU computing. This processing time is negligible compared with the acquisition time of BOTDA, which makes real-time denoising possible.

AB  - In this work, we apply deep learning to estimate the direction-of-arrival (DoA) of multiple narrowband signals with a uniform linear array in a coherent environment. First, the logarithmic eigenvalue-based classification network (LogECNet) is introduced to enhance signal number detection accuracy in challenging scenarios, such as the low signal-to-noise (SNR) regime and limited snapshots. Next, a multi-label classification model called the root-spectrum network (RSNet) is devised to estimate the DoAs using the signal number inferred by LogECNet. In the proposed architecture, the full-row Toeplitz matrices reconstruction (FTMR), which exploits all rows of the signal covariance matrix (SCM), is combined with LogECNet and RSNet to inversely map the SCM to the numerical DoAs in the coherent scenario. It is shown that the eigenvalues factorized from the FTMR output matrix become more robust sources for signal enumeration than those of the forward/backward spatial smoothing (FBSS) algorithm. Furthermore, the logarithmic scaling of the eigenvalues of the FTMR results in LogECNet outperforming other detectors. The simulation results show our proposed method not only improves the signal number detection and angular estimation performance, but also achieves the complexity reduction with respect to the prior schemes.

AB  - Narrowband active noise control (ANC, NANC) systems have been developed for attenuating noises that are generated by rotating machines such as motors, cutting machines, diesel engines, fans, etc. The conventional feedforward NANC systems adopt a non-acoustic sensor to detect and extract the noise signal frequencies for creating the reference sine and cosine waves, leading to high implementation cost as well as performance degradation due to frequency mismatch (FM). In this paper, we propose a new efficient feedback NANC system where an adaptive notch filter bank is utilized to construct the reference sinusoidal signals for the ANC system controller that consists of multiple two-weight magnitude/phase adjusters (MPA). The proposed system is also equipped with an online secondary-path modeling (SPM) subsystem that is capable of compensating the secondary-path drift. Extensive simulations are conducted to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed system.

AB  - The harmonic reducer is a key component of the industrial robot. Its reliability has significant influence on the consecutive operation of the industrial robot. However, its failure rate is high due to the complicated internal structure and long-term working conditions of large load and high torque. To identify the fault type of the harmonic reducer under different working conditions, this article proposes the joint wavelet regional correlation threshold denoising (WRCTD) algorithm and convolutional neural network-long short term memory (CNN-LSTM) fault detection method. Firstly, the WRCTD algorithm utilizes the regional correlation of the wavelet decomposition coefficients and the  $3\sigma $  criterion to suppress noise in the raw sensor data. Then, the CNN-LSTM model could mine hidden features of the processed sensor data to identify fault correctly. To evaluate the proposed method, the vibration signals of the harmonic reducer under different working conditions are collected by establishing a test rig. Comparative experimental results show that the proposed WRCTD algorithm can significantly improve the accuracy of the fault detection method. The specific values for the CNN-LSTM method and the LSTM method are 9.5% and 12.2%, respectively. In addition, the proposed CNN-LSTM method has better performance than traditional methods. It achieves the fault detection over 94.0%, which is 1.5%, 2.0%, 2.0%, 1.9%, and, 1.9% higher than the highest accuracy values of CNN, LSTM, and SVM methods in five experiments.

AB  - This research proposes a single-sensor acoustic emission (AE) scheme for detection and localization of crack in steel rail (rail head, rail web, and rail foot) under load. In the operation, AE signals were captured by the AE sensor and converted into digital signal data by AE data acquisition module. The digital data were used total variation denoising (TVD) algorithm to remove ambient and wheel/rail contact noises, and the denoised data were processed and classified to localize cracks in the steel rail using a deep learning algorithmic model. The AE signals of pencil lead break at the head, web, and foot of steel rail were used to train (80 % of the input data) and test (20%) the algorithmic model. In training and testing the algorithm, the AE signals were divided into two groupings (150 and 300 AE signals) and the classification accuracy compared. The deep learning-based AE scheme was also implemented on-site to detect cracks in the steel rail. The total accuracy under the first and second groupings were 86.6 % and 96.6 %. The novelty of this research lies in the use of single AE sensor and AE signal-driven deep learning algorithm to detect and localize cracks in the steel rail, unlike conventional AE crack-localization technology which relies on two or more sensors and human interpretation.

Improved fast Fourier transform is used to extract the characteristics of fiber vibration signal. In the part of data processing, the train track is trained by the algorithm of vibration band search, judgment and correction. The data fitting method is used to predict the track of the train with too much disturbance. A data-driven method is used to set the adaptive threshold to deal with the nonlinear problem of optical fiber signals. The simulation part verifies the feasibility of the algorithm.

AB  - Frequency modulated continuous wave radar systems are a common component of many driver assistance systems. Modern radar systems are heavily used for fast and reliable surrounding area sensing in both safety and automated driving applications. Recently a lot of of neural networks have been introduced for real time detection and classification of vulnerable road users without the need for traditional radar signal processing. One of these systems is based on the real-time object detection system YOLO (You Only Look Once) applied to the pre-processed radar range-Doppler-angle power spectrum. Therefore, the radar cube data is interpreted as a digital image for the computer-vision based YOLO algorithm. This paper deals with the possibility to increase performance of this algorithm, especially in noisy environments, by adding a denoising autoencoder (DAE) structure to the neural network. The DAE input is the noisy radar sensor data represented as an image. Adapted from computer vision applications, the DAE is trained to reconstruct an uncorrupted representation of the input data and hence reduces the noise effects from the measurement data. Furthermore, the domain adaptation capability of the neural network is researched, using simulated measurement data to improve training.

AB  - It is the main challenge for Global Positioning System (GPS)/Inertial Navigation System (INS) to achieve reliable and low-cost positioning solutions during GPS outages. A new GPS/INS hybrid method is proposed to bridge GPS outages. Firstly, a data pre-processing algorithm based on empirical mode decomposition (EMD) for wavelet de-noising is developed to reduce the uncertain noise of IMU raw measurements and provide accurate information for subsequent GPS/INS data fusion and training samples. Then, the interactive multi-model extended Kalman filter(IMM-EKF) algorithm is proposed to improve the robustness of Kalman filter output and the accuracy of model training target output. Finally, a new intelligent structure of GPS/INS based on Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is proposed. When the GPS is available, the IMM-EKF is used to fuse the GPS and de-noised INS data, and the de-noised INS data and the outputs of IMM-EKF are used to train the ELM. During GPS outages, the ELM is used to predict and correct the INS position error. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, 3 tests were performed in the actual field test. The comparison results show that the proposed fusion method can significantly improve the accuracy and reliability of positioning during GPS outages.

AB  - The development of the industrial Internet of Things paradigm brings forth the possibility of a significant transformation within the manufacturing industry. This paradigm is based on sensing large amounts of data, so that it can be employed by intelligent control systems (i.e., artificial intelligence algorithms) eliciting optimal decisions in real time. Ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the intelligent wireless sensing and control system pipeline is crucial toward achieving this goal. Nevertheless, the presence of noise in actual wireless transmission processes considerably affects the quality of the sensed data. Typically, noise and anomalies present in the data are very difficult to distinguish from each other. Conventional anomaly-detection techniques generate many error reports, which cause the control systems to issue incorrect responses that hinder the industrial production. In this article, a novel solution is proposed to denoise data while simultaneously preserving the actual anomalies. The proposed approach operates by measuring both the neighbor and background contrasts in computing a noise score. The trust level of each data point is then calculated through a correlation measure to purge spurious data. Extensive experiments on real datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach yields effective performance, as compared to existing methods, and it meets the requirements of low latency—facilitating the normal operation of the monitored control systems.

Since multiple sensors can be installed on the train to obtain real-time data, information fusion is a promising method that can be used to combine each sensor's unique information to calculate the stable and accurate localization results. A multi-sensor based localization system for the train autonomous control is proposed in this paper, which contains the Global Positioning System, Inertial Navigation System and velocity sensor. Covariance Intersection algorithm is proposed to integrate the output results of each sensor. Besides, considering the variety of the train running environment, adaptive Kalman filter is applied to reduce the impact of environmental noise. Finally, simulation results prove the proposed method in this paper improves the positioning accuracy compared with the traditional methods.

AB  - In recent years, with the development of hyper-velocity weapon, the research focus of penetration effect has switched gradually from high-velocity to hyper-velocity, with insufficient studies on penetration effect and its internal mechanism. Besides, the study on penetration effect of hyper-velocity weapon depends on the measurement of mechanical signal during penetration of projectile. In this paper, dynamic test of hyper-velocity impact penetration acceleration signal is studied in depth. Firstly, the penetration velocity and acceleration of projectile under the impact load are analyzed, the influence of the movement of the testing unit on the measured acceleration signal is studied, and the factors to be considered when measuring the hyper-velocity impact load are given. Further, this paper designs a measurement circuit and dynamic models of each measurement module, details the influence of dynamic characteristics of power delivery network on test accuracy, and provides a method to obtain dynamic characteristics of power delivery network by virtue of S parameter. Finally, to extract the real penetration overload signal, a superior noise reduction algorithm adopting Modified Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (MEEMD) is proposed, taking dynamic uncertainty and degree of approximation as evaluation indicators, and the measured sensor data is analyzed and processed with the proposed superior noise reduction algorithm. The experiment results show that, this method has a better noise reduction effect, and can be adopted to effectively extract real penetration overload signal. The results have theoretical research and application value to evaluate the reasonableness and effectiveness of measurement method of hyper-velocity penetration overload signal, and seek for a superior processing method for the noisy penetration overload signal.

AB  - Dynamic Vision Sensor (DVS) event camera output includes uninformative background activity (BA) noise events that increase dramatically under dim lighting. Existing denoising algorithms are not effective under these high noise conditions. Furthermore, it is difficult to quantitatively compare algorithm accuracy. This paper proposes a novel framework to better quantify BA denoising algorithms by measuring receiver operating characteristics with known mixtures of signal and noise DVS events. New datasets for stationary and moving camera applications of DVS in surveillance and driving are used to compare 3 new low-cost algorithms: Algorithm 1 checks distance to past events using a tiny fixed size window and removes most of the BA while preserving most of the signal for stationary camera scenarios. Algorithm 2 uses a memory proportional to the number of pixels for improved correlation checking. Compared with existing methods, it removes more noise while preserving more signal. Algorithm 3 uses a lightweight multilayer perceptron classifier driven by local event time surfaces to achieve the best accuracy over all datasets. The code and data are shared with the paper as DND21.

AB  - The navigation algorithms which use inertial measurement units (IMUs), such as inertial navigation systems (INSs), always suffer from intrinsic accumulated errors. Bias in gyros induces a significant drift in navigation output especially when micro-electro-mechanical sensor (MEMS) type is used. This error has high- and low-frequency components. De-noising of the long-term error (LTE) (the low-frequency component) is more challenging due to undeterministic behavior and overlapping with carrier motion in the low-frequency band. In this article, a method for de-noising of long-term MEMS-based gyro is presented. In this approach, an auto-regressive (AR) model for the LTE is developed which is being used as the process part of a Kalman filter. To separate the low-band motion dynamic from LTE in the measurement part of the Kalman Filter, the last time epoch of gyro data is subtracted from the current time epoch (memory-based filter). Some static and dynamic experiments have been done for the algorithm evaluation. The static test shows the reduction of LTE by 50%. Also, the method is invoked in INS/Doppler velocity log (DVL) integrated navigation system as a gyro prefilter. The results show that drift and point-to-point final error in position are reduced between 4% and 70% by invoking the de-noising method for gyros.

AB  - In the safety protection system of the railway electric multiple unit (EMU), the safety of the running part is extremely important. The daily detection of the internal hazard defects of the wheels in the running parts relies on a professional trackside fault online diagnosis system based on the ultrasonic sensor probe array data. However, the on-line ultrasonic diagnosis of EMU wheels is usually accompanied by various interference noises. The defect echo signals collected by the sensor probe array are weak and are easily submerged by noise, which makes it impossible to perform effective defect identification. This paper proposes an improved threshold function to overcome the discontinuous shortcomings of the classical wavelet soft threshold function and hard threshold function in view of the non-stationary characteristics of the ultrasonic detection signal of the EMU wheels. This paper proposes a sine-type threshold processing function. It is characterized by adopting gradual compression processing to denoise the echo signal of the ultrasonic sensor probe array. In order to verify the validity, the continuity at the threshold is observed through the linear space vector signal, and the algorithm is simulated and tested through the three-dimensional Gaussian echo mathematical model of the ultrasonic signal and the measured ultrasonic envelope signal. Experimental results show that the improved threshold function can suppress the noise in the ultrasonic echo data, improve the signal-to-noise ratio, and retain the waveform characteristics of the defect signal, which is conducive to defect recognition.

AB  - Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have been increasingly applied for environmental monitoring in recent years. However, the sensor data drift is a serious issue affecting the reliability of monitoring system. Based on the assumption that the neighboring nodes have correlated measurements, this paper presents a novel algorithm using constrained extreme learning machine and Kalman filter (CELM-KF) for tracking and calibrating drift of sensor data. CELM-KF has two phases: training phase and calibrating phase. In the training phase, the wavelet denoising method is used for data preprocessing. Then the cluster head trains the model of the constrained extreme learning machine (CELM) using the measurements of its neighbors to obtain the prediction data of the target sensor. In the calibrating phase, we track and correct the data drift of target sensor using Kalman filter. To evaluate the performance of CELM-KF, simulation experiments on different datasets are conducted, and two parameters including decision coefficient and mean square error (MSE) of CELM-KF are compared with those of existing algorithms. The simulation results show that CELM-KF can successfully calibrate the sensor data drifts.

AB  - Recently, the colloidal quantum dot spectrometer has received much attention due to its advantages in cost, size, and operation. Yet, just like many other filter-based miniature spectrometers, spectrum reconstruction for the colloidal quantum dot spectrometer is typically prone to the measurement noise due to the correlation of the filters. In this paper, we propose an effective spectrum reconstruction method for the colloidal quantum dot spectrometer, which can recover high-quality spectra in noisy environments. Specifically, we employ a denoising autoencoder, a machine-learning approach, to reduce noise in the filters' raw measurements before performing the reconstruction. After that, we reconstruct the spectra with the denoised data by a sparse recovery algorithm. We investigate the feasibility of the proposed reconstruction approach on a synthetic dataset and an experimental dataset collected by the colloidal quantum dot spectrometer. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach could deliver accurate reconstruction results even when data are corrupted with the measurement noise.

AB  - Telemonitoring of diaphragmatic electromyogram (EMGdi) signal in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and Internet of Things (IoT) holds the promise to be an evolving direction in personalized medicine. The WSNs and IoT enable EMGdi information telemonitoring and communications technologies play important roles in the process of personal medical care, especially for the respiratory diseases. However, while designing such a system, one should consider the required functionality, miniaturization, energy efficiency, etc., to make fewer resources required in WSNs and IoT. Conventional methods of data acquisition cannot energy-effectively compress data with reduced device costs. Different from the traditional compression methods, compressed sensing (CS) takes promising steps toward these challenges. Unfortunately, EMGdi is not sparse in time domain. Hence, current CS algorithms are extremely difficult to use directly for recovering EMGdi. In order to satisfy the requirements of applications of personal medical care in WSNs and IoT, this study proposes an approximated ι0 norm based method to search the solution via the gradient descent method, then projects the searched solution to the reconstruction feasible set. Meanwhile, this study adopts a new wavelet threshold based method to denoise the electrocardiographic interference. Experimental results are provided to testify the performance of the proposed methods.

AB  - We propose and experimentally demonstrate a scheme for accelerated fast BOTDA. The effect of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) on recovery performance of compressed sensing is simulated and analyzed, it is found that a reduction in SNR requires much larger frequency data to recover the original Brillouin gain spectrum (BGS). To enable a high recovery probability, Block-Matching and 3D filtering (BM3D) algorithm is employed to enhance the SNR of Brillouin time trace and reduce the number of averages. Combining with a principal component analysis (PCA) based compressed sensing technique, the Brillouin gain spectrum (BGS) can be successfully reconstructed from only 37.5% frequency data. In the experiment, 75 randomly selected frequency data is acquired to reconstruct the BGS. Distributed strain sensing is achieved over 15 km single-mode fiber with 3 m spatial resolution and 0.52 MHz Brillouin frequency shift (BFS) uncertainty. Due to the accelerated process, the measurement time with 40 averages is less than 0.5 s.

AB  - The presence of rain can negatively affect the performance of many sensors such as X-band radar. In this paper, an effective approach is proposed to mitigate the effect of rain on significant wave height ( ${H}_{s}$ ) estimation from X-band radar sensor data along with a machine-learning (ML)-based method. First of all, the haze removal algorithm is applied to rain-contaminated radar images as pre-processing. Then, three different features are extracted from the processed radar images. Different combinations of these three features are utilized to estimate  ${H}_{s}$  under the rain condition by using support vector regression (SVR)-based and temporal convolutional network (TCN)-based regression methods. It is found that the root-mean-square-errors (RMSEs) of  ${H}_{s}$  estimation results using two typical methods (signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)-based and ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD)-based linear fitting methods) are decreased by 0.14 m and 0.48 m after introducing the haze removal algorithm, respectively. Also, a relatively high accuracy can be achieved using the SVR-based regression method with the combination of SNR and gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) features. Compared to the SNR-based and EEMD-based linear regression methods, the proposed SVR-based method further improves the estimation accuracy, with reductions of RMSE by 0.19 m and 0.82 m, respectively.

AB  - This paper presents an algorithm developed to detect and locate Partial Discharge (PD) signals in generators using wavelet transform techniques. The signals obtained from the sensors in the generator are de-noised by Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). The original signal is decomposed into high and low frequencies to assist in the elimination of noise. The filtered signal is passed through a localisation process utilising the continuous wavelet transform (CWT), which will be shown in the time-frequency domain. The signals obtained at locations in the time domain can be analysed to determine their frequency content allowing a comparison of their characteristics to the standards of partial discharges in generators. The experimental results indicate that the proposed technique could efficiently decrease noise through application of the Daubechies 4 (Daub4) as a mother wavelet and lowering the signal to level 12. The results also show that this condition could lead to accurate performance in locating the time of the signal and determining the frequency of the PD signal via the CWT.

AB  - Industrial Internet-of-Things (IIoT) applications require reliable and efficient wireless communication. Assuming dense wireless sensor networks (WSNs) operating in a harsh environment, a concept of a time-division multiple access (TDMA)-based WSN enriched with electronically steerable parasitic array radiator (ESPAR) antennas is proposed and examined in this work. The utilized antenna provides one omnidirectional and 12 directional radiation patterns that can be electronically switched by the sensor node. We introduce a relay discovery algorithm, which selects those sensor nodes with an ESPAR antenna capable to act as relay. The selection of the relay nodes is based on a certain link quality threshold that algorithm uses as input. The outcome is a reduction in the number of layers or hops with a guaranteed Quality of Service (QoS). To emphasize the physical aspect of the wireless propagation, we introduce the measured antenna radiation patterns and consider two different path-loss propagation models representing blockage-free and blockage-prone industrial environments. A number of network simulations were performed and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as a link quality measure was examined with respect to the network density and different measured radiation pattern settings. The main outcomes show a tradeoff between SNR per link and the percentage of nodes that can serve as relays. As a result, we propose network design guidelines that take under consideration the QoS range with respect to SNR together with an optimal number of antenna radiation patterns that should be selected as a tradeoff between latency, energy consumption, and reliability in a network.

AB  - At present, there is only one image sensor and a color filter array covering its surface to collect color images in most imaging devices. Each pixel of the collected color image can only obtain one color component from digital image sensor directly, and the other two color missing components need to be calculated through color interpolation. Since Bayer-type color filter array widely used in various kinds of sensors has good color signal sensitivity and color recovery characteristic, we reconstruct the two missing color components in Bayer mode images in this paper according to it. Two Color Interpolation algorithms widely used in digital imaging devices are introduced in detail in this paper, Gradient Edge-oriented (GEO) Interpolation Algorithm and Adaptive Color Plane (ACP) Interpolation Algorithm, and then we present a modified adaptive Color layer Interpolation Algorithm based on them. In the experiments, 10 images are selected from the IVC database. 40 sets of data are generated from the images and then they are used to analyze from Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR), Structural Similarity (SSIM), Feature Similarity (FSIM) and Computing Time quality metrics to study the quality of the 10 images after the processing of interpolation. This four metrics are the basis of judging the processing effect of MACP, GEO and ACP algorithms. The results of the experiments show that Modified adaptive Color plane (MACP) algorithm can solve the contradiction effectively between the reconstruction of high-quality color images and reduction of computational complexity, and improve the processing speed of color image reconstruction exactly.

AB  - Most existing source-oriented image and video clustering algorithms based on sensor pattern noise (SPN) rely on the pairwise similarities, whose calculation usually dominates the overall computational time. The heavy computational burden is mainly incurred by the high dimensionality of SPN, which typically goes up to millions for delivering plausible clustering performance. This problem can be further aggravated by the uncertainty of the orientation of images or videos because the spatial correspondence between data with uncertain orientations needs to be reestablished in a brute-force search manner. In this work, we propose a rotation-invariant binary representation of SPN to address the issue of rotation and reduce the computational cost of calculating the pairwise similarities. Results on two public multimedia forensics databases have shown that the proposed approach is effective in overcoming the rotation issue and speeding up the calculation of pairwise SPN similarities for source-oriented image and video clustering.

AB  - Due to the continuous improvement of solid-state lighting technologies, multispectrum, multicolor LEDs have been used as transmitters for wavelength division multiplexing visible light communication (WDM-VLC) techniques. Although the multispectrum LEDs can emit light with different wavelengths for multichannel transmission, the overlapped spectra across the WDM channels could cause high interband multichannel interferences (IBMCI). Accordingly, the large-scale filter-array detectors (LFDs) have been adopted to WDM-VLC techniques and shown high capability for the IBMCI rejection using the maximum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) combining (MSC) method. However, in the MSC method, it requires 100% filter array usage ratio, which would potentially result in costly computational complexity. In this paper, we propose two approaches, namely, conjugate gradient (CG) algorithm approach and binary particle swarm optimization (BPSO) algorithm approach, for sparse filter selection. According to both simulation and experimental results, the proposed CG algorithm approach can significantly reduce the filter array usage ratio by up to 70% while maintaining a good detector output SINR. The proposed BPSO algorithm approach can provide a near optimal detector output SINR while maintaining a good reduction of filter array usage ratio.

AB  - As a kind of widely used switchgear in power system, the reliability of gas insulated switchgear (GIS) is very important for the safe operation of power systems. However, there is a lack of research on intelligent detection technology of mechanical state of GIS at present. A new method is urgently needed to improve the operability, effectiveness, and accuracy of fault detection in GIS. Aiming at the abnormal vibration signals generated by GIS faults, this article presents a fault diagnosis method (GA-DBSCAN) consisting of a feature selection method based on genetic algorithm (GA) and Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN), and a fault diagnosis method based on DBSCAN. First, this article analyzes the incentive force of GIS and discusses the characteristic frequency of response signal combining with the non-linear characteristics of a GIS system. Second, GA and DBSCAN are used to screen features for dimension reduction and get the optimized feature space, and DBSCAN-based classification is used to classify faults. Finally, optimized feature space is verified to be superior to the original feature space by typical classification method; the superiority and reliability of DBSCAN-based classification method under optimized feature space is verified by comparing with other classification methods. The proposed GA-DBSCAN approach can substantially increase the performance of the fault diagnosis method, which indicates that the method promotes development of intelligent detection technology of mechanical state in GIS.

AB  - In-sensor energy-efficient deep learning accelerators have the potential to enable the use of deep neural networks in embedded vision applications. However, their negative impact on accuracy has been severely underestimated. The inference pipeline used in prior in-sensor deep learning accelerators bypasses the image signal processor (ISP), thereby disrupting the conventional vision pipeline and undermining accuracy of machine learning algorithms trained on conventional, post-ISP datasets. For example, the detection accuracy of an off-the-shelf Faster RCNN algorithm in a vehicle detection scenario reduces by 60%. To make in-sensor accelerators practical, we describe energy-efficient operations that yield most of the benefits of an ISP and reduce covariate shift between the training (ISP processed images) and target (RAW images) distributions. For the vehicle detection problem, our approach improves accuracy by 25-60%. Relative to the conventional ISP pipeline, energy consumption and response time improve by 30% and 34%, respectively.

AB  - High-G MEMS accelerometer (HGMA) is widely used in the aerospace field and the precise control of missiles. Therefore, its calibration accuracy is critical to sensor performance and the overall control system. In order to decrease the influence of noise on the HGMA output signal, a hybrid denoising algorithm which is based on the Time-frequency peak filtering (TFPF), Local mean decomposition (LMD) and Sample entropy (SE) has been proposed in this article. For the problem that the TFPF algorithm is limited in the choice of window length, LMD and SE are used to distinguish components, which can improve the TFPF algorithm effectively. It provides a better balance between noise reduction and signal fidelity. Firstly, the noise-containing signal can be decomposed by LMD to obtain PFs. Secondly, calculate the sample entropy values of each PFs, then divide the signal into mixed component, useful component and noise component according to the similarity of sample entropy. Thirdly, the mixed component can use long-window TFPF to reduce noise, the short-window TFPF can reduce the noise for the useful component, and the noise component can be wiped off directly. Finally, the useful component and the mixed component are both reconstructed to form the final denoised signal. Experiments have showed that this method can not only remove noise (the noise of static signal is reduced by 91.76%, the signal-noise ratio of dynamic signal has increased to 17.6), but also retain the details of frequency and amplitude (the shock peak amplitude error is 0.062% and the vibration amplitude error is 0.04%). Therefore, this method can reduce the noise of the High-G MEMS accelerometer signal with maintaining the characteristics of the original signal, thereby greatly improves the performance of the accelerometer, making it widely used.

AB  - In this paper, we consider fast wireless data aggregation via over-the-air computation (AirComp) in Internet of Things (IoT) networks, where an access point (AP) with multiple antennas aim to recover the arithmetic mean of sensory data from multiple IoT devices. To minimize the estimation distortion, we formulate a mean-squared-error (MSE) minimization problem that involves the joint optimization of the transmit scalars at the IoT devices as well as the denoising factor and the receive beamforming vector at the AP. To this end, we derive the transmit scalars and the denoising factor in closed-form, resulting in a non-convex quadratic constrained quadratic programming (QCQP) problem concerning the receive beamforming vector. Different from the existing studies that only obtain sub-optimal beamformers, we propose a branch and bound (BnB) algorithm to design the globally optimal receive beamformer. Extensive simulations demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed algorithm in terms of MSE. Moreover, the proposed BnB algorithm can serve as a benchmark to evaluate the performance of the existing sub-optimal algorithms.

AB  - The detection of wafer faults in early process steps through monitoring and analyzing multivariate process trace data contribute to wafer yield improvements. Standard classification algorithms have been generally used for fault detection and classification (FDC). However, this approach can cause information loss while extracting statistical features from the trace data and cannot consider class imbalance situations where much fewer faulty wafers are generated than normal wafers. In addition, the approach does not consider normal wafer-to-wafer (W2W) variations and sensor noise inherent in the trace data. These drawbacks significantly degrade FDC performance. This paper proposes a method that builds an FDC model only with trace data of normal wafers in which W2W variations and sensor noise exist. The one-class FDC method detects the occurrence of abnormal trace patterns that cause wafer faults by removing W2W variations and sensor noise from raw traces by using denoising autoencoders, and this method finds the fault-introducing process parameters with the occurrence times. In experiments using the trace data of etch and chemical vapor deposition processes, the proposed method exhibited 1% and 6% higher performance than the best-performing method among comparison methods in terms of the geometric mean of the normal and fault detection accuracies.

AB  - This chapter discusses the study of the signal enhancement problem in the frequency domain with a single sensor. In many respects, the frequency domain approach is equivalent to the spectral method. The advantages of the frequency‐domain technique are twofold. First, it is very flexible, in the sense that the observation signal at each frequency can be processed independently of the others. Second, all algorithms can be implemented very efficiently by using the fast Fourier transform. The chapter starts by formulating the problem. It then explains how to perform noise reduction with just simple gains. The chapter gives all kinds of optimal gains derivation results and shows how one can compromise between distortion of the desired signal and reduction of the additive noise. It also explains how these gains can be implemented in the short‐time Fourier transform domain. Finally, the chapter gives all relevant performance measures.

AB  - Distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) technology is a rapidly evolving fiber-optic sensing technology that has been gradually applied to vertical seismic profile (VSP) data. The DAS VSP data are often contaminated by multiple interference waves, such as random noise, coupled noise, horizontal noise, and the existing methods can only map it from noisy data to effective reflections. However, interference waves are also a relative concept, and many interference waves still have certain application values. Therefore, this article proposes an innovative algorithm called attribute-guided target data separation network (Att-TDSN), which can not only complete the conventional signal-noise separation task but also achieve noise-noise separation task. Specifically, we first propose a flexible and efficient training set, namely, multidimensional weak label training set (Mul-WLTS), which introduces attribute features as the weak labels and specifies the dimension of weak labels according to the number of target data types (effective reflections and several common interference waves). Then, we use the weak labels to guide our network to map training data to specified data types, assisting the network to focus its attention on each kind of target data. Finally, the network parameters are trained by a training mode called “one-way matching and two-way constraint.” “One-way matching” makes data separation result unique, and “two-way constraint” can improve the algorithm’s amplitude preserving ability. Experiments on synthetic and field DAS VSP data show that our network can accurately separate target data. Moreover, for the traditional denoising task, Att-TDSN also has a better denoising performance than existing methods.

AB  - Sensors typically record their measurements using more precision than the accuracy of the sensing techniques. Thus, experimental and observational data often contains noise that appears random and cannot be easily compressed. This noise increases storage requirement as well as computation time for analyses. In this work, we describe a line of research to develop data reduction techniques that preserve the key features while reduce the storage requirement. Our core observation is that the noise in such cases could be characterized by a small number of patterns based on statistical similarity. In earlier tests, this approach was shown to reduce the storage requirement by over 100-fold for one-dimensional sequences. In this work, we explore a set of different similarity measures for multidimensional sequences. During our tests with standard quality measures such as PSNR, we see that the new compression methods reduce the storage requirements over 100-fold while maintaining relatively low errors in peak signal-to-noise ratio. Thus, we believe that this is a new and effective way of constructing data reduction techniques.

AB  - Advanced image sensors with high resolution are now being developed for specially purposed electro-optical systems, with research focused on robust image quality performance in terms of super resolution and noise removal under various environmental conditions. Recently, machine-learning and deep-learning methods have been studied as the best practical techniques for restoration to improve the deteriorated image quality of sensors. However, these methods show limitations and side effects of image degradation such as image non-uniformity. In this paper, we analyze and randomly generate additive white Gaussian noise, non-uniform line noise, and dark saturation as representative image degradations. We then propose an advanced U-net model based on global and local residual learning in order to restore complexly deteriorated images. The proposed method shows unparalleled performance compared to alternative models and previous studies. In particular, various complex noise components are minimized and improved with equal quality so that variation between sequential images is minimized. These findings leverage mutual corroboration of quantitative and qualitative evaluation metrics. In the future, the proposed model is expected to contribute to a wide range of field applications such as defense, surveillance, and video media for image quality enhancement technologies.

AB  - In the radio channels of cellular networks, signals generally propagate through multiple paths in scattering environments. Multipath Components (MPCs) are shown to be distributed in different groups, known as clusters, in Channel Impulse Responses (CIRs). Clustering MPCs is a critical step in channel measurement and modeling. Many clustering algorithms have been proposed but few of them are able to handle noise effectively. In this paper, we propose a de-noising MPC-clustering framework based on a new Space-Transformed Fuzzy c-Means (ST-FCM) algorithm and the fusion of channel measurement snapshots. ST-FCM solves the issue that the Multipath Component Distance that quantifies the similarity among MPCs cannot be adopted in the conventional FCM algorithm. Then we apply the Dempster-Shafer evidence theory to fuse the clustering results of multiple snapshots, which can detect and remove noise by making a full use of all the measurement data. Furthermore, we design a censoring process for hard partition and a validation process to determine the optimal number of clusters. We have performed extensive simulations on MPC clustering using the CIRs generated by the Third Generation Partnership Project 3-dimensional channel models. We also have developed a space-time channel sounder and have performed experiments in a typical rural macrocell scenario. The simulation and experiment results have shown that the proposed framework has a better performance in clustering accuracy than the current methods.

AB  - Detecting and tracking moving targets is a challenging task, which becomes even harder in underwater scenarios due to the extremely low levels of signal-to-noise ratio associated with common acoustic measures. In the context of continuous marine monitoring, a further challenge is provided by the need to deploy computationally efficient methods that guarantee minimum use of power resources in off-shore monitoring platforms. Here we present a novel approach to accurately detect and track moving targets from the reflections of an active acoustic emitter. Our system is based on a computationally- and energy-efficient deep convolutional denoising autoencoder. System performance is evaluated both on simulated and emulated data, and benchmarked against a probabilistic tracking method based on the Viterbi algorithm.

AB  - In this article, a new Kurtosis based deflation Independent Component Analysis (ICA) algorithm is proposed. Contrary to conventional Kurtosis based deflation ICA algorithms where the separator vector is obtained by optimizing a given Kurtosis-based objective function using gradient-like approaches, the proposed algorithm performs a component-wise optimization of this separator vector through an alternating maximization strategy. This leads to an exact computation of each component of the separator vector by simply rooting a 4-th order polynomial derived from the objective function. The good performance of the proposed algorithm is confirmed and compared to two well known ICA algorithms, namely FastICA and RobustICA.

AB  - This paper describes a blind transmitter localization technique based on the deep neural network (DNN) framework. Blind localization assumes no previous knowledge on the transmit signal. It is shown that DNN based location approaches the maximum likelihood solution with reduced computational complexity. Moreover, the maximum likelihood, least squares and radio environment map localization estimators are presented in order to compare the design and performance of the proposed DNN algorithm. The system model is built based on a wireless sensor network that collects received signal strength measurements assuming disturbances of distance dependent correlated shadowing noise. Performance evaluation using numerical simulations shows that the proposed DNN scheme achieves location accuracy similar to the optimum maximum likelihood estimator while presenting computational complexity reduction of more than 90%.

AB  - A novel fusion algorithm is proposed based on Improved Adaptive Wavelet Threshold De-noising (IAWTD), C-means Support Vector Machine (CSVM) and Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) method to eliminate the humidity drift of MEMS gyroscope. Firstly, the IAWTD method is employed to decrease the humidity drift component in MEMS gyroscope output signal. Then, the humidity drift compensation model is established: the input elements are the relative humidity, the change rate of relative humidity and the humidity drift, and the output is the compensated MEMS gyroscope output signal by EEMD method. In order to verify the compensation effect of the fusion algorithm, the gyroscope outputs are collected and analyzed with the relative humidity ranged from 40% to 90% based on the temperature varying from 20°C to 60°C. The results show that the IAWTD-CSVM-EEMD method significantly reduces the influence of relative humidity drift on the gyroscope output, according to the quantitative analysis of Allan variance, the quantization noise of the gyroscope output decreases by 87.78%, 96.37%, 97.77%, 99.17% and 92.62% respectively under the relative humidity ranging from 40% to 90%, as the temperature rose from 20 °C to 60 °C at intervals of 10 °C. In addition, the bias stability decreases by 96.9%, 99.41%, 99.1%, 99.46%, and 99.78% respectively and the angle random walk decreases by 88.16%, 96.54%, 98.16%, 94.43%, and 92.05% respectively at different temperatures. It is worth mentioning that, to further verify the applicability of the fusion algorithm, a group of comparative experiments are added to consider the influence of temperature changes on the gyroscope output under different relative humidity. The experimental results show that the quantization noise, bias stability and angle random walk of the MEMS gyroscope are significantly reduced compared with the original output after processing by IAWTD-CSVM-EEMD. Therefore, the method proposed in this paper is beneficial to reduce the humidity drift in the MEMS gyroscope output.

AB  - With the development of information technology and network technology, as well as sensing technology, more and more data are collected from the processing of producing and machining in industrial sites. Industrial data are usually with noises and errors because the interference of ambient and the fault of sensors. Data preprocessing is necessary for analyzing further. The local polynomial regression is usually used to data denoising because of its characters of simplicity and flexibility, but the smoothing parameter of this algorithm need to be manually set by trial and error. In this paper, an adaptive parameter optimization method is used to calibrate its parameter, that is, the multi-indicator fusion method is used to fuse the root mean square error (RMSE), signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and smoothness (r) of the denoised signal into a composite evaluation indicator. The smoothing parameter corresponding to the minimum value of the indicator is the optimal smoothing parameter of the denoising algorithm. A data set which is collected from monitoring the temperature field and thermal error of a heavy-duty CNC machine tool is used to validate the method.

AB  - Many point cloud acquisition methods, e.g. multi-viewpoint image stereo matching and acquisition of depth data from active light sensors, suffer from significant geometry noise in the data. In the existing literature, denoising of this geometry noise has been performed using only geometry information. In this paper, based on the notion that color attributes are correlated with the geometry, we propose a novel geometry denoising technique that takes advantage of this correlation via a graph-based optimization process. In particular, we construct a graph based on both color and geometry information, and use it for graph-based Tikhonov regularization. Results on synthetic and real-world point clouds show that the proposed denoising method significantly outperforms existing geometry-only techniques.

AB  - The raw vibration signal of rolling element bearing carrying a great deal of information representing the mechanical equipment's health conditions, but the impulsive signal of interest (SOI) is usually hidden in heavy noise, and denoising technique is great significant to the fault diagnosis. High resolution time-frequency algorithms, such as the wavelet based synchrosqueezing transform, have a wide range of applications in removing noise, and multichannel sensor technology has highlighted the requirement for multivariate denoising. In this paper, a multivariate wavelet denoising method based on synchrosqueezing is proposed. The mutual modulated oscillations of multivariate data is identified by partitioning the time-frequency domain, and a modified universal threshold is employed to remove the noise components while to retain SOI. Numerical simulations and experimental investigations are included to illustrate the feasibility and performance of utilizing the novel method to process faulty signal of rolling element bearing.

AB  - This article presents a reconfigurable processor based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm for reconstructing compressively sensed physiological signals. The architecture is flexible to support physiological ExG [electrocardiography (ECG), electromyography (EMG), and electroencephalography (EEG)] signal with various signal dimensions (128, 256, 384, and 512). Data characteristics are utilized to substantially reduce the overall hardware complexity by up to 99%. A 16× folded architecture achieves a 64% area-power product reduction compared with the unfolded one. A customized buffer is used for multi-word access, which reduces data latency by four times. It dissipates 75% less power with only 25% area when compared with the realization with conventional flip-flops. As a proof of concept, a reconfigurable processor for reconstructing ExG signals is presented. Fabricated in a 40-nm CMOS technology, the processor integrates 3.69-M gates in 3.23 mm2. The chip delivers a throughput of 573-2901 kSamples/s (kS/s) for ExG signals and dissipates less than 12.6 mW at 87 MHz from a 0.60-V supply. Compared with state-of-the-art designs, the chip achieves a 1.5-to-14× higher throughput with 3.2-to-11× less energy, given the performance specification [reconstruction signal-to-noise ratio (RSNR) ≥ 15 dB].

AB  - The spatial resolution of hyperspectral sensor is limited and the surface features are complicated, and each pixel contains more material information, resulting in the existence of a large number of mixed pixels. Therefore, the research on endmember extraction method have been becoming a hotspot in the hyperspectral field. The extraction method which is based on specificity analysis is greatly influenced by abnormal points in the image. This paper mainly combines the pixels' density with distance statistics to analyze different types ofpixels, and then use distribution statistic information to remove the interference of pixels with abnormal properties. On this basis, ATGP, VCA, SGA and NMF are used respectively to conduct the endmember extraction, and then analyze and study the accuracy of the endmember extraction algorithm combining with distribution statistics. Then the validity of this algorithm is verified by simulating hyperspectral images and real hyperspectral images.

AB  - Vibration signals acquired by accelerometers are commonly used in the field of bearing fault diagnosis. The measured vibration signals contain a series of impulse responses when localized bearing faults occur. These impulses are often viewed as fault features and exhibit nonlocal self-similarity in terms of morphological characteristics. However, the impulses are generally contaminated by background noise. In this paper, a group-based K-SVD denoising algorithm, which exploits the nonlocal self-similarity property, is presented to extract bearing fault features. In contrast to regular K-SVD denoising, this denoising algorithm forms groups by clustering similar signal segments and regards each group rather than each segment as the basic unit of sparse representation. To group similar segments, we further propose a particular grouping method that exploits bearing prior knowledge (i.e., possible impulse spacings). The new grouping method could form groups in a targeted manner, thereby achieving more accurate grouping. Group-based K-SVD denoising is able to extract fault features better as similar segments collaboratively provide a large amount of shared feature information, especially in the presence of strong noise (such as signal-to-noise ratios lower than -10 dB). The numerical and experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of group-based K-SVD denoising over regular K-SVD denoising and other two benchmark algorithms (i.e., wavelet shrinkage and spectral kurtosis).

AB  - Dynamic Vision Sensor (DVS) is a new type of neuromorphic event-based sensor, which has an innate advantage in capturing fast-moving objects. Due to the interference of DVS hardware itself and many external factors, noise is unavoidable in the output of DVS. Different from frame/image with structural data, the output of DVS is in the form of address-event representation (AER), which means that the traditional denoising methods cannot be used for the output (i.e., event stream) of the DVS. In this paper, we propose a novel event stream denoising method based on probabilistic undirected graph model (PUGM). The motion of objects always shows a certain regularity/trajectory in space and time, which reflects the spatio-temporal correlation between effective events in the stream. Meanwhile, the event stream of DVS is composed by the effective events and random noise. Thus, a probabilistic undirected graph model is constructed to describe such priori knowledge (i.e., spatio-temporal correlation). The undirected graph model is factorized into the product of the cliques energy function, and the energy function is defined to obtain the complete expression of the joint probability distribution. Better denoising effect means a higher probability (lower energy), which means the denoising problem can be transfered into energy optimization problem. Thus, the iterated conditional modes (ICM) algorithm is used to optimize the model to remove the noise. Experimental results on denoising show that the proposed algorithm can effectively remove noise events. Moreover, with the preprocessing of the proposed algorithm, the recognition accuracy on AER data can be remarkably promoted. The source code of the proposed method is available at https://web.xidian.edu.cn/wjj/paper.html.
