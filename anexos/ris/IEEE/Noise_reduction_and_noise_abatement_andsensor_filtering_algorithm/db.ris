AB  - A low-power low-noise RF-to-baseband (BB)-current-reuse quadrature receiver employing simultaneous noise and input power matching and 1/f noise reduction technique is proposed for the Internet of Things applications. The receiver shares bias current between a low-noise transconductor and a transimpedance amplifier with single supply voltage and employs a double-balanced current-mode passive mixer with 25% duty-cycle local oscillator (LO), thereby reducing power consumption. To improve noise performance in the direct-conversion or low-IF receiver, the proposed receiver architecture performs simultaneous noise and input power matching at the RF domain and 1/f noise reduction at the BB domain. The presented prototype, implemented in the 65-nm CMOS process, occupies an active die area of 0.559 mm2 while consuming 3.6 mW at a supply voltage of 1.8 V. It achieves a voltage gain of 40.7 dB, an noise figure (NF) of 1.94 dB, S11 of less than -10 dB, and an IIP3 of -25.6 dBm.

AB  - This article proposes a novel wideband common-gate (CG) common-source (CS) low-noise amplifier (LNA) with active feedforward for simultaneous current and noise reduction. By employing an active feedforward stage in the main path, the current dissipation and the thermal noise are effectively suppressed, while the noise and distortion cancelation properties of CG-CS topology are preserved. Moreover, no extra noise is introduced since the additional gm-boost amplifier follows the same noise-canceling (NC) principle as the CG amplifier, and its noise can be fully canceled at the output theoretically. Thus, the proposed LNA benefits from the gm-boosting and NC technique simultaneously to obtain a good tradeoff between gain, noise figure (NF), and power consumption. Fabricated in standard 40-nm CMOS technology, the measured results show the proposed LNA exhibits a peak gain of 17 dB, NF of 3.5-5.5 dB from 1 to 11 GHz and an IIP3 of -2.8 dBm at 6 GHz. It consumes 9 mW from a 1.2-V supply and occupies a very compact die area of 0.061 mm2.

AB  - This article presents a noise-shaping time-to-digital converter (TDC) based on an inverted ring oscillator (IRO). By inverting the oscillation direction, the proposed IRO-TDC achieves quantization error and mismatch noise shaping, in-band noise reduction, coherent noise cancellation, and low disturbance to power supply at the same time. A noise model is proposed to analyze the noise performance of the proposed TDC, and to compare its noise with TDCs based on gated ring oscillator (GRO) and switched ring oscillator (SRO). An IRO-TDC prototype is fabricated in a 65 nm CMOS technology to verify the proposed IRO technique and noise model. With a sampling rate of 200 MS/s, the TDC achieves an integrated noise of 196 fsrms in a 3 MHz bandwidth with a constant power dissipation of 13.2 mW. The measured coherent noise cancellation ratio is up to 36.4 dB. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of an oscillator utilizing oscillation inversion for noise reduction and coherent cancellation to protect the TDC from power supply noise, ground noise, and substrate noise. Due to its noise cancellation and low disturbance to power supply, the proposed IRO technique also alleviates the design complexity of power supply in future TDC applications.

AB  - This brief proposes a broadband noise-cancelling (NC) common-gate (CG)-common-source (CS) low-noise amplifier (LNA) with a passive network to improve the gain and noise performance simultaneously. In the CG-CS LNA with active feedforward, a current-bleeding (CBLD) circuit is required to provide the required DC current of the auxiliary amplifier, which introduces additional noise. In the proposed work, by adding a passive network at the output, the noise of the CBLD circuit can be made negligible. Moreover, the passive network also provides the shunt peaking to facilitate the gain and noise performance over the desired band. Fabricated in TSMC 40 nm CMOS technology, the measured results show the proposed LNA exhibits a gain of 16.5 – 19.5 dB, a noise figure (NF) of 3.2 – 5.2 dB from 2 to 12 GHz and an IIP3 of −3.5 dBm at 6 GHz. It consumes 9 mW from a 1.2 V supply and occupies a very compact die area of 0.092 mm2.

AB  - Random noise attenuation is an important step in seismic processing. A method with an adaptive threshold based on scale and directional characteristics of shearlet transform is proposed to attenuate seismic random noise. The method can adaptively calculate threshold according to the decomposed scales and directions, where the directional characteristics are embodied by using the L1 norm of coefficients. Compared to the universal threshold and the threshold based on scale methods only, the scale and directional threshold methods can remove random noise and reserve an effective signal to the utmost extent. The synthetic and field data examples demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly improve the denoising effect and has the stronger denoising ability.

AB  - In this letter, a low phase-noise (PhN) oscillator is designed, implemented, and experimentally tested using an active and compact Giuseppe Peano fractal resonator as a filter with high-quality factor (QF) which acts as the frequency stabilization and selection element. The oscillation frequency corresponds to the frequency response peak of the complex QF filter. Due to the characteristics of this active filter, the oscillator PhN is highly reduced. The oscillator, operating at 3.36 GHz with 15-dBm output power, demonstrates a measured PhN of -131.5 dBc/Hz at 100-kHz offset frequency and 151.4 dBc/Hz at 1-MHz offset frequency. It is shown that the proposed oscillator outperforms the state-of-the-art microwave planar oscillators in reducing the PhN.

AB  - We studied a method for reduction of environmental magnetic noise in magnetocardiograms using independent component analysis, which is a useful technique to separate signal from noise. However, this separation usually relies on subjective choices of the independent components to reconstruct the signal. Hence, we propose a method for quantitative component selection using attractor analysis and coefficient of multiple determination. We verified the noise reduction accuracy using low signal-to-noise ratio experimental data (0 and -10 dB). First, a threshold derived from the coefficient of multiple determination was determined from the results for independent component selection. Then, noise reduction accuracy was evaluated from the spatial correlation coefficients obtained using the proposed method. The results show a considerable reduction of noise for a threshold of 0.6, with its accuracy being almost equal to the maximum noise reduction accuracy obtained from the best selection pattern.

AB  - We demonstrate that a graded-index plastic optical fiber (GI POF) enables higher-quality radio-over-fiber (RoF) transmission of an orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) signal, compared with a conventional multimode fiber, for short-distance household applications (<; 100 m). It is shown that the improvement in OFDM signal transmission, using the GI POF, can be attributed to the reduction in noise and intermodulation distortion, owing to the external optical feedback from the transmission fibers. The low noise and low distortion in the signal transmission are mainly due to the strong mode coupling in the GI POF, which is closely related to the microscopic heterogeneous structures in core polymer materials. The developed GI POF will be invaluable for RoF networks in households as a solution for indoor broadband wireless communications in the upcoming 5G era.

AB  - Transient electromagnetic (TEM) detection has been widely used in the fields of mineral resources exploration, hydrogeological survey and engineering survey, but electromagnetic interference can lead to late signal distortion, so it has become an urgent problem to suppress the electromagnetic noise of TEM signal and improve the interpretation accuracy of TEM signal. For the first time, this paper introduces the approach of variational mode decomposition (VMD) into the field of TEM signal-noise reduction. The half homogeneous space model and the three-layer earth model were constructed to compare the noise reduction effect of the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) approach and the VMD approach on the three main noises (random noise, power frequency noise, and sferics noise) in the TEM signal. The results are compared with the wavelet threshold denoising approach to verify the superiority of the VMD approach relative to the EMD approach. The results show that the VMD approach is better than the decomposition result of the EMD approach in the signal-noise separation of TEM signals. In addition, the VMD approach is applied to the measured TEM data in a region in southern Shanxi Province, which effectively improves the quality of TEM signals. This indicates that the VMD approach is expected to be used for signal interference suppression in the field of TEM detection in the future.

AB  - This letter proposes a transform domain communication system (TDCS) based on chirp noise sequence to deal with its high peak to average power ratio (PAPR). The optimal chirp noise sequence is obtained by the selective mapping to improve PAPR reduction of the proposed TDCS waveform with low complexity. Compared with other PAPR reduction algorithms, such as magnitude weighting selection and complementary peak reducing signal, the proposed TDCS based on optimal chirp noise sequence has about 1.5 dB PAPR reduction gain without extra bit error rate loss.

AB  - We propose a deep-learning approach based on generative adversarial networks (GANs) to reduce noise in weak lensing mass maps under realistic conditions. We apply image-to-image translation using conditional GANs to the mass map obtained from the first-year data of Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) Survey. We train the conditional GANs by using 25 000 mock HSC catalogues that directly incorporate a variety of observational effects. We study the non-Gaussian information in denoised maps using one-point probability distribution functions (PDFs) and also perform matching analysis for positive peaks and massive clusters. An ensemble learning technique with our GANs is successfully applied to reproduce the PDFs of the lensing convergence. About $60{{\ \rm per\ cent}}$ of the peaks in the denoised maps with height greater than 5σ have counterparts of massive clusters within a separation of 6 arcmin. We show that PDFs in the denoised maps are not compromised by details of multiplicative biases and photometric redshift distributions, nor by shape measurement errors, and that the PDFs show stronger cosmological dependence compared to the noisy counterpart. We apply our denoising method to a part of the first-year HSC data to show that the observed mass distribution is statistically consistent with the prediction from the standard ΛCDM model.

AB  - The objective of binaural speech enhancement algorithms is to reduce the undesired noise component, while preserving the desired speech source and the binaural cues of all sound sources. For the scenario of a single desired speech source in a diffuse noise field, an extension of the binaural multichannel Wiener filter (MWF), namely the MWF-IC, has been recently proposed, which aims to preserve the interaural coherence (IC) of the noise component. However, due to the large complexity of the MWF-IC, in this paper we propose several alternative algorithms at a lower computational complexity. First, we consider a quasi-distortionless version of the MWF-IC, denoted as minimum-variance-distortionless response (MVDR-IC). Second, we propose to preserve the IC of the noise component using the binaural MWF with partial noise estimation (MWF-N) and the binaural MVDR beamformer with partial noise estimation (MVDR-N), for which closed-form expressions exist. In addition, we show that for the MVDR-N a closed-form expression can be derived for the tradeoff parameter yielding a desired magnitude squared coherence (MSC) for the output noise component. Since contrary to the MWF-IC and the MWF-N the MVDR-IC and the MVDR-N do not take into account the spectro-temporal properties of the speech and the noise components, we propose to apply a spectral postfilter to the filter outputs, improving the noise reduction performance. The performance of all algorithms is compared in several diffuse noise scenarios. The simulation results show that both the MVDR-IC and the MVDR-N are able to preserve the MSC of the noise component, while generally the MVDR-IC shows a slightly better noise reduction performance at a larger complexity. Further, simulation results show that applying a spectral postfilter leads to a very similar performance for all considered algorithms in terms of noise reduction and speech distortion.

AB  - In active noise control systems, the performance of the most celebrated filtered-x-least mean square (FxLMS) adaptive algorithm is degraded in the presence of non-linearity in the secondary path. In this article, we propose a novel approach to improve the performance of FxLMS algorithm in the presence of saturation type non-linearity in the secondary path. In the proposed method, the weights of the controller are adapted by minimizing a cost function consisting of two terms. The first term is the squared instantaneous residual error while the second term is the weighted square of the difference between input and output of (estimated) saturation non-linearity. Consequently, in case the saturation has occurred, the resultant adaptive algorithm minimizes the residual error while keeping the controller output close to its saturation limit. This avoids unnecessary fluctuation of the (controller) weights due to large variation (or windup) of the controller output after the saturation has occurred. Numerical simulations are provided to verify the superiority of the reported approach as compared to existing methods under different conditions.

AB  - In this paper, an innovative hybridized deep learning framework (EN-CNN) is presented for image noise reduction where the noise originates from heterogeneous sources. More specifically, EN-CNN is applied to the benchmark natural images affected by a mixture of additive white gaussian noise (AWGN) and impulsive noise (IN). Reduction of mixed noise (AWGN and IN) is relatively more involved as compared to removing simply one type of noise. In fact, mitigating the impact of a mixture of multiple noise types becomes exceedingly challenging due to simultaneous presence of different noise statistics. Although, various effective deep learning approaches and the classical state-of-the-art approaches like WNNM have been used to suppress AWGN noise only, the same techniques are not suitable in case of mixed noise. In this context, EN-CNN can not only infer changed noise statistics but can also effectively eliminate residual noise. Firstly, EN-CNN employs the classical method of neighborhood filtering followed by non-local low rank estimation to respectively reduce IN noise and estimate the residual noise characteristics after reducing IN noise. As a result of this step, we obtain a pre-processed image with residual noise statistics. Secondly, convolutional neural network (CNN) is applied to the pre-processed image based on the noise statistics inferred in the first step. This two pronged strategy, in conjunction with the deep learning mechanism, effectively handles the mixed noise suppression.

AB  - This work presents a low noise active pixel sensor. It uses one additional transistor compared to standard 4T pixel to obtain 1/f noise reduction and high conversion gain. 1/f noise is reduced by periodically switching the in-pixel source follower between depletion and inversion. The depletion state is achieved by re-configuring the source follower into a MOS capacitor and depleting the channel by controlling the source-drain terminal. The state change of the in-pixel source follower also enhances the conversion gain. The test chip has a 64 × 64 pixel array with a 10 μm pixel pitch fabricated in 350 nm AMS process. The measured integrated noise of a pixel in the frequency band 128 Hz to 50 KHz is 728 μVrms without switching. At a switching frequency of 4 MHz, the integrated noise reduces to 306 μVrms after switching resulting in a 7.5 dB reduction. The input referred noise is reduced from 26erms- to 7.3erms- after applying switching. When both, switching and conversion gain enhancement are applied, the input referred noise is further reduced to 2.3erms- with an enhanced conversion gain of 398 μV/e-.

AB  - Ball valve is the core control component for flow in HVAC (Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning) system. And valve's flow noise is one of the key parameters to evaluate its performance. Ball valve's flow field is modeled by finite element method based on Lighthill acoustic theory. And turbulent kinetic energy of the flow field is obtained. The noise generation mechanism of ball valve's flow is obtained by analyzing the contours of pressure, velocity and sound pressure level. In order to reduce sound pressure level of ball valve, noise reduction scheme was proposed. And ball valve was reformed. Flow field characteristics of the modified ball valve are analyzed by numerical simulation method. The feasibility of noise reduction scheme is verified by experiments. The results show that refitted ball valve has good noise reduction effect while guaranteeing small change of flow.

AB  - The electrocardiogram (ECG) is an efficient and noninvasive indicator for arrhythmia detection and prevention. In real-world scenarios, ECG signals are prone to be contaminated with various noises, which may lead to wrong interpretation. Therefore, significant attention has been paid on denoising of ECG for accurate diagnosis and analysis. A denoising autoencoder (DAE) can be applied to reconstruct the clean data from its noisy version. In this paper, a DAE using the fully convolutional network (FCN) is proposed for ECG signal denoising. Meanwhile, the proposed FCN-based DAE can perform compression with regard to the DAE architecture. The proposed approach is applied to ECG signals from the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia database and the added noise signals are obtained from the MIT-BIH Noise Stress Test database. The denoising performance is evaluated using the root-mean-square error (RMSE), percentage-root-mean-square difference (PRD), and improvement in signal-to-noise ratio (SNRimp). The results of the experiments conducted on noisy ECG signals of different levels of input SNR show that the FCN acquires better performance as compared to the deep fully connected neural network- and convolutional neural network-based denoising models. Moreover, the proposed FCN-based DAE reduces the size of the input ECG signals, where the compressed data is 32 times smaller than the original. The results of the study demonstrate the superiority of FCN in denoising, with lower RMSE and PRD, as well as higher SNRimp. According to the results, we believe that the proposed FCN-based DAE has a good application prospect in clinical practice.

AB  - The noise level of an image depends on settings of an imaging device. The settings can be used to select appropriate parameters for denoising methods. But denoising methods based on deep convolutional neural networks (deep-CNN) do not have such adjustable parameters. Therefore, a deep-CNN whose training data contain limited levels of noise does not effectively restore images whose noise level is different from the training data. If the range of noise levels of training data is extended to solve the problem, the maximum performance of a produced deep-CNN is limited. To solve the tradeoff, we propose a deep-CNN that is adjustable to the noise level of the input image immediately. We use soft shrinkage for activation functions of our deep-CNN. The soft shrinkage has thresholds proportional to the noise level given by the user. We also propose an optimization method for proportionality coefficients for the thresholds of soft shrinkage. Our method optimizes the coefficients for various noise levels simultaneously. In our experiment using a test set whose noise level is from 5 to 50, the proposed method showed higher PSNR than that in the case of the conventional method using only one deep-CNN, and PSNR comparable to that in the case of the conventional method using multiple noise-level-specific CNNs.

AB  - One of the major topics of switched reluctance machines (SRMs) is how to reduce the acoustic noise and vibration without decreasing the efficiency. In this paper, a few novel current profiling methods are proposed to reduce the acoustic noise by flatting the radial force sum and to reduce optimal torque ripple with best efforts to enhance the efficiency. The proposed method is adopted to the 18/12 pole SRM, which has identical outer dimensions and competitive torque, output power, efficiency, and operating region of the permanent-magnet motor used in the hybrid vehicles. It is found that the proposed method can improve not only the radial force ripple characteristic but also the iron loss minimization. The efficiency enhancement is also found to be possible in a few cases depending on the demanding criteria; thanks to the phase shift of the fundamental component of the current waveform. The proposed method is verified in the experiments.

AB  - Robustness, simple construction, and low cost are some of the advantages of switched reluctance machines (SRMs). These are all desirable characteristics of an electric motor, especially in the automotive sector, where high-temperature and high-speed operation, and low cost are always in demand. However, the acoustic noise generation by conventionally controlled SRMs can prevent its use in applications where acoustic comfort is required. Acoustic noise is radiated by the stator frame when a vibration mode is excited by the respective spatial order at a forcing frequency that is close to the stator's modal natural frequency. The excitation surface wave is the radial force density waveform, which is a function of time and spatial position. In this paper, a phase radial force shaping method is proposed by using harmonic content analysis. A generic function for the radial force shape is identified, whose parameters are calculated by an optimization algorithm to minimize the torque ripple for a given average torque. From the phase radial force profile, a current reference is obtained. The proposed methodology is experimentally validated with a four-phase 8/6 SRM through acoustic noise measurements at different speed and load conditions.

AB  - Recently, many studies have demonstrated deep neural network (DNN) classifiers can be fooled by the adversarial example, which is crafted via introducing some perturbations into an original sample. Accordingly, some powerful defense techniques were proposed. However, existing defense techniques often require modifying the target model or depend on the prior knowledge of attacks. In this paper, we propose a straightforward method for detecting adversarial image examples, which can be directly deployed into unmodified off-the-shelf DNN models. We consider the perturbation to images as a kind of noise and introduce two classic image processing techniques, scalar quantization and smoothing spatial filter, to reduce its effect. The image entropy is employed as a metric to implement an adaptive noise reduction for different kinds of images. Consequently, the adversarial example can be effectively detected by comparing the classification results of a given sample and its denoised version, without referring to any prior knowledge of attacks. More than 20,000 adversarial examples against some state-of-the-art DNN models are used to evaluate the proposed method, which are crafted with different attack techniques. The experiments show that our detection method can achieve a high overall F1 score of 96.39 percent and certainly raises the bar for defense-aware attacks.

AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images are difficult to analyze due to speckle noise, which is a characteristic of multiplicative noise. Over the last few decades, a number of studies have been performed regarding the removal of speckle noise. However, the existing studies exhibit edge information loss when removing speckle noise. In this paper, we propose an algorithm using speckle reducing anisotropic diffusion (SRAD), soft thresholding, and a guided filter to effectively remove speckle noise from SAR images while preserving edge information. The proposed algorithm first obtains a filtered image by applying an SRAD filter to a noise image. To further remove the multiplicative noise remaining in the filtered image, a logarithmic transformation is applied to convert it into additive noise. The filtering image was decomposed into multiresolution images using discrete wavelet transform (DWT). Soft thresholding and a guided filter were used for each of the high-frequency subimages and the low-frequency subimage. Then, an inverse DWT and an exponential transform are applied to the denoised image. The experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm shows better performance than the conventional filtering method in terms of both objective and subjective performances.

AB  - Wide bandgap devices enable high power density power converters. Despite the advantages of increased switching frequency, the passive components are still a major bottleneck toward enabling high power density. Among the passive components in the converter, the passive electromagnetic interference (EMI) filters are unavoidable to ensure compliance with conducted EMI standards. Active EMI filters (AEFs) help reduce the volume of the passive components and have been around for three decades now. The design and implementation of the AEFs depend upon the type of noise (common-mode or differential-mode) and power converter (ac-dc, dc-dc or inverter). This article presents a comprehensive survey of different AEFs and their implementations for different power converters presented in the literature. A comprehensive survey of noise-sensing, noise-processing, and noise-cancellation circuits is presented. Also, a comparison of attenuation provided by the AEFs for common-mode and differential-mode noises for different converters is carried out. Furthermore, other facets of AEFs such as the auxiliary power supply, power loss, and protection methods for the AEF are also summarized. This article is intended to be a useful reference for power converter designers in both industry and academia.

AB  - A novel method is proposed to derive the current waveform to reduce noise and vibration of a switched reluctance motor in a magnetically saturated region. Principle of noise and vibration reduction is based on reducing the variation of the radial force sum. To realize the minimum variation in the sum of the radial forces, radial force expression has been derived. In a magnetically saturated region, radial force expression is approximated with Fourier series with parameters as a function of current. With the proper approximation of radial force, the current waveform is derived to minimize the variation of the radial force sum. The proposed current waveform consists of dc, fundamental, second, and third harmonic components. Finite-element analysis and experiment result are included to show the validity of the proposed method.

AB  - In large-scale wireless acoustic sensor networks (WASNs), many of the sensors will only have a marginal contribution to a certain estimation task. Involving all sensors increases the energy budget unnecessarily and decreases the lifetime of the WASN. Using microphone subset selection, also termed as sensor selection, the most informative sensors can be chosen from a set of candidate sensors to achieve a prescribed inference performance. In this paper, we consider microphone subset selection for minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) beamformer based noise reduction. The best subset of sensors is determined by minimizing the transmission cost while constraining the output noise power (or signal-to-noise ratio). Assuming the statistical information on correlation matrices of the sensor measurements is available, the sensor selection problem for this model-driven scheme is first solved by utilizing convex optimization techniques. In addition, to avoid estimating the statistics related to all the candidate sensors beforehand, we also propose a data-driven approach to select the best subset using a greedy strategy. The performance of the greedy algorithm converges to that of the model-driven method, while it displays advantages in dynamic scenarios as well as on computational complexity. Compared to a sparse MVDR or radius-based beamformer, experiments show that the proposed methods can guarantee the desired performance with significantly less transmission costs.

AB  - A Grid-tied inverter utilizing wide bandgap devices can achieve higher switching frequency resulting in a power filter with reduced size and weight. However, the increased switching frequency may lead to more switching harmonics entering the electromagnetic interference (EMI) frequency range, which will increase the size of EMI filter. Interleaving paralleled converters can cancel some of the switching harmonics and reduce the size of EMI filter. However, nonideal interleaving will deteriorate the harmonic canceling effect. In this research, the nonideal effects are found to be from the small mismatch of the pulsewidth of the interleaving legs and the mismatch of the impedance between the interleaving legs. A modulation method is proposed to completely eliminate the pulsewidth mismatch. Compared with other solutions, the proposed method does not require the information of filter parameters, neither gate driver synchronization, and nor a special function block of the digital controller. The proposed modulation was implemented on a 150 MHz digital signal processor and a 100 MHz field-programmable gate array, and was experimentally verified on a 100 kW parallel coupled SiC PV inverter prototype.

AB  - Multichannel linear prediction-based dereverberation in the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) domain has been shown to be highly effective. Using this framework, the desired dereverberated multichannel signal is obtained by filtering the noise-free reverberant signals using the estimated multichannel autoregressive (MAR) coefficients. To use such methods in the presence of noise, especially in the case of online processing, remains a challenging problem. Existing sequential enhancement structures, which first remove the noise and then estimate the MAR coefficients, suffer from a causality problem as both the optimal noise reduction and dereverberation stages depend on the current output of each other. To address this problem, an algorithm that consists of two alternating Kalman filters to estimate the noise-free reverberant signals and the (MAR) coefficients is proposed. The causality of the estimation procedure is important when dealing with time-variant acoustic scenarios, where the MAR coefficients are time-varying. The proposed method is evaluated using simulated and measured acoustic impulse responses and is compared to a method based on the same signal model. In addition, a method to control the reverberation reduction and noise reduction independently is derived.

AB  - Enhancement-mode gallium nitride (eGaN) high-electron-mobility transistors (HEMTs) are promising to increase the switching frequency into multimegahertz for the high power density. However, it is a serious challenge to identify the equivalent lumped capacitances of megahertz multiwinding planar transformers for common-mode (CM) noise analysis to optimize the electromagnetic interference filters. The couple turn with its one-capacitor model is proposed to quantify the total CM noise current via the high-frequency transformer. With the modeled total CM noise current, the equivalent lumped interwinding capacitance model of the transformer can be derived conveniently and accurately. A complete CM noise path model is built for a GaN-based active clamp forward with a self-driven synchronous rectification multioutput converter. Then, a CM noise cancelation capacitance is applied and optimized to generate a reverse extraction current to cancel the CM noise current. Compared with other methods, the proposed modeling technique can build the equivalent lumped interwinding capacitance model of the multiwinding planar transformer in the printed circuit board layout stage before it is fabricated physically. The proposed model is verified by the experimental results with a 1-MHz GaN prototype with 100-V input, 5-V/6-A, and ±12-V/ 0.83-A outputs. The CM noise spectrum is well predicted. The CM noise is reduced by around 15 dB (a reduction of 12.6%) below 9 MHz.

AB  - Two proposed methods of reducing radiation noise caused by inductive power transfer (IPT) systems using spread spectrum techniques were experimentally demonstrated. In IPT systems for electric vehicles (EVs) or plug-in hybrid EVs (PHEVs), noise reduction techniques are necessary because the radiation noise from the IPT system for EVs or PHEVs must not exceed the limits defined by noise standards, such as the well-known regulation set by the International Special Committee on Radio Interference. In the proposed methods, the radiation noise from the transmission coils of the IPT system is spread in the frequency domain by randomly changing the output frequency of the inverter. The output frequency is selected according to the generation of pseudorandom numbers. In the first proposed method, spread spectrum with a uniform distribution (SSUD), the output frequency is selected from the frequency range of 80 to 90 kHz with an even distribution. In the second method, spread spectrum with a biased distribution (SSBD), the output current of the inverter is considered. The possibility of selecting an output frequency in the given range is biased in proportion to the combined impedance from the transmission coil and the resonance capacitors on the primary side. In experiments with a 3-kW prototype, when SSUD and SSBD were applied, the fundamental components of the radiation noise were suppressed by 4.45 and 8.27 dB · μA, respectively, in comparison with the noise obtained using the conventional system, which operates the inverter at a fixed frequency.

AB  - Hyperspectral images (HSIs) are often degraded by different noise types such as Gaussian and sparse noise. In this letter, a hyperspectral mixed Gaussian and sparse noise reduction technique, the HyMiNoR, is proposed. The proposed technique, hierarchically, removes the mixed noise. First, the Gaussian noise is removed using a recently developed automatic hyperspectral noise removal technique called hyperspectral restoration (HyRes). Then, we develop a novel sparse noise removal technique to remove the sparse noise, including salt and pepper noise, missing pixels, and missing lines. The performance of the proposed approach has been validated using both real and simulated data sets. Results on the simulated data set confirm considerable improvements in terms of signal-to-noise ratio and singular angle distance compared to the state-of-the-art techniques used in the experiments. In addition, visual improvements can be clearly observed in the case of real data set experiments.

AB  - We investigate the use of a derivative-free control scheme called the multiple-delay proportional-retarded (PR) protocol to achieve fast consensus in a large-scale multiagent system. The delays are intentionally introduced in the PR with the purpose of creating derivative-like controllers that rely only on position measurements, thus mitigating undesirable noise effects. The main result places the spectral abscissa of the consensus dynamics at a desired locus and also achieves a user-defined spectral “separation,” both of which directly influence convergence to consensus. Design rules and limitations arising from analytical derivations to achieve these results are laid out. Case studies are provided to demonstrate the concepts.

AB  - This brief aims to intuitively explain and numerically verify the observed phenomenon of flicker noise reduction in oscillators of reduced conduction angle (i.e., in class-C), which has been presented in literature but never properly explained. The flicker phase noise in a voltage-biased oscillator capable of operating in class-B and class-C is compared and numerically verified using a commercial simulation model of TSMC 28-nm CMOS. We illustrate how narrowing the conduction angle can suppress the 1/f noise up-conversion by decreasing 1/f noise exposure to the asymmetric rising and falling edges of oscillation waveform. The effects of implicit common-mode tank in the class-C operation is also discussed. We further clarify ambiguities among several simulation methods of impulse sensitivity function (ISF) based on periodic small-signal analysis [periodic AC or periodic transfer function (PXF)], which is a key tool in understanding the flicker noise up-conversion. A clearer ISF simulation method based on positive sidebands of PXF is proposed.

AB  - The electromagnetic noise of a claw pole alternator is minimized by rotor claw chamfering in this paper. Taguchi method was first applied to evaluate the importance of all of the six chamfer parameters on the output current and the main magnetic force harmonic, and three strongly influential parameters were later selected. Subsequently, the mathematical models of the output current and the sound power level with respect to the three chamfer parameters were developed using the response surface method. Finally, the three parameters were further optimized using the genetic algorithm. A prototype of the optimally designed claw pole alternator was manufactured and its performance was tested. Results show that the rotor claw chamfer does not decrease the output current but can reduce the noise significantly. The sound power level is decreased by more than 15 dB(A) after optimization. The trailing edge chamfer is better than the leading edge chamfer regarding noise reduction.

AB  - This letter presents a wideband high-gain fourstage cascode D-band low noise amplifier (LNA) implemented in a 0.13-μm SiGe BiCMOS technology. A shunt inductor that is used at the intermediate node of the cascode topology to reduce the noise contribution of the common base transistor is analyzed and employed for the first time for the SiGe HBT technology. Furthermore, the staggered-tuning technique based on the Butterworth distribution is utilized to have a wideband flat-gain characteristic. The designed LNA has a measured 32.6-dB peak gain at 144.5 GHz with a 3-dB bandwidth of 52 GHz. The measured noise figure (NF) is lower than 6.1 dB across the whole D-band, and its minimum value is 4.8 dB. The total dc power consumption is 28 mW. To the authors' best knowledge, these results demonstrate the lowest NF performance and the widest 3-dB bandwidth among the Dband LNAs implemented in the silicon-based technologies. The effective chip area excluding the pads is 0.6 mm2, and the total IC occupies an area of 1 mm2.

AB  - Recent smartphones increasingly employ a metal frame for a sophisticated design. However, the metal frame becomes a good coupling path for electromagnetic (EM) noise within smartphones and increases noise coupling to radio-frequency antennas located at the top and bottom sides of the smartphones. This paper proposes two novel metal frame structures with ferrite absorbing sheets or electromagnetic band gap patterns to reduce the coupling of EM noise to the antenna. Using a fabricated test board, the effects of the proposed metal frames on noise coupling suppression are experimentally validated.

AB  - In this article, a new noise reduction/cancellation technique is proposed to improve noise figure (NF) of a broadband low-noise transconductance amplifier (LNTA) for 5G receivers. The LNTA combines a common-gate (CG) stage for wideband input matching and a common-source (CS) stage for canceling the noise and distortion of the CG stage. Yet, another noise reduction is applied to reduce the channel thermal noise of the noise cancellation stage itself. The technique further exploits current reuse and increases transconductance of the CS transistor while keeping its power consumption low. Fabricated in 28-nm CMOS, the proposed LNTA is capable of driving an external 50-Ω load and achieves a NF of 2.09-3.2 dB and input return loss (S11 ) better than -10 dB over the 3-dB bandwidth of 20 MHz-4.5 GHz while consuming 4.5 mW from a single 1-V power supply. The achieved gain (S21) and IIP3 are 15.2 dB and -4.6 dBm, respectively.

AB  - Two-level voltage source inverters with pulse width modulation (PWM) generate multiple carrier harmonics, thereby exciting high-frequency noise from the motor. Based on a special dual-branch three-phase permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM), a method that utilizes a known modified space vector PWM technique is proposed. This method is able to suppress unpleasant high-frequency vibration noise as well as acoustic noise more effectively than other methods. Vibration noise near the twice carrier frequency is eliminated, and PWM vibration noise around the carrier frequency is also reduced. In particular, vibration and acoustic noise at the twice carrier frequency are eliminated using a carrier phase-shift of 0.5π and the special winding structure of the dual-branch PMSM. The effectiveness of the proposed method is confirmed using detailed experimental results.

AB  - In wireless acoustic sensor networks (WASNs), sensors typically have a limited energy budget as they are often battery-driven. Energy efficiency is, therefore, essential for the design of algorithms in WASNs. One way to reduce energy costs is to select only the sensors that are most informative, a problem known as sensor selection . In this way, only sensors that significantly contribute to the task at hand will be involved. In this paper, we consider a more general approach, which is based on rate-distributed spatial filtering. Depending on the distance over which a transmission takes place, the bit rate directly influences the energy consumption. We try to minimize the battery usage due to transmission, while constraining the noise reduction performance. This results in an efficient rate allocation strategy, which depends on the underlying signal statistics, as well as the distance from sensors to a fusion center (FC). Through the utilization of a linearly constrained minimum variance beamformer, the problem is derived as a semidefinite program. Furthermore, we show that rate allocation is more general than sensor selection, and sensor selection can be seen as a special case of the presented rate-allocation solution, e.g., the best microphone subset can be determined by thresholding the rates. Finally, numerical simulations for estimating several target sources in a WASN demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the sensor-selection-based approaches in terms of energy usage, and we find that the sensors close to the FC and point sources are allocated with higher rates.

AB  - This paper presents a novel technique for single slope analog to digital converter (SSADC) to suppress the rowwise noise in CMOS image sensor. A sample switch is used in the current-steering DAC to reduce the noise introduced by bias circuits, which will deteriorate the characteristic of uniformity in the row direction. The sample switch can fix the voltage which biases the current source in the current-steering DAC when generating a ramp to avoid the ramp fluctuation in the time domain. The digital correlated double sampling is used to reduce the non-uniformity in column-level ADCs. The CMOS image sensor prototype is fabricated in 110nm 1P3M process. The 10-bit SSADC achieves DNL of -0.20 / +0.15 LSB and INL of -1.35 / +0.91 LSB at a sampling frequency of 29.2 KHz. It is proved that the row-wise noise is reduced from 764μVrmsto 163μVrmsat a frame rate of 228 fps using the proposed sample switch structure. The prototype photos taken by the sensor show that the row-wise noise is reduced under the low-illumination circumstance effectively.

AB  - Increasing the number of pole pairs leads to a lower electromagnetic yoke, and therefore, lower vibration and magnetic noise occur. In this paper, the influence of different numbers of pole pairs on the vibroacoustic design aspects of the machine is studied for the first time using a multislice subdomain method (MS-SDM) while considering the natural frequencies under a variable speed analysis. This paper aims to determine the optimal number of pole pairs for a low-speed, high-torque permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) with double-layer, fractional-slot, nonoverlapping, concentrated windings (FSCWs) for wind turbine applications. First, all possible slots per pole per phase combinations, which offer the use of double-layer FSCW, are studied through a magnetomotive force (MMF) harmonic analysis. Second, the MS-SDM of the PMSG is studied to examine the vibroacoustic performance under a variable speed analysis. Finally, all affected major parameters are compared in order to find the optimal pole number of the PMSG. To verify the MS-SDM-based results, both 3-D finite element analysis and experimental investigations are employed.

AB  - In this paper, a selection of a few current references for acoustic noise reduction in the 36-24 and the 18-12 switched reluctance motors is presented. It is seen that the difference in radial force profile results in few optimal current references. It is found that the optimal current reference with extreme radial force sum flattening results in increased rms current and loss in a magnetically saturated region of the 18-12 SRM. Thus, proper selection of the current references is necessary. Analysis, simulation, and experimental results are presented with the conventional and optimal currents to verify the effectiveness of flattening radial force sum method in acoustic noise reduction. It is shown that effective acoustic noise reduction and efficiency improvement are confirmed with proposed current reference selection.

AB  - To improve the stability accuracy of two-axis inertially stabilized platform (ISP) for airborne star tracker application, a stable control method based on active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) is presented to handle the system nonlinearities, parameter uncertainties, and disturbances. A noise reduction method based on a modified disturbance observer (DOB) structure is proposed to suppress sensor noise and improve anti-disturbance capability and rapidity. Moreover, the robust stability of the proposed method is discussed. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, simulations and laboratory experiments are implemented. Finally, the vehicle tracking star experiments are performed. In addition, the contrast results show that for the two-axis ISP the presented controller has superior performance in anti-jamming ability, rapidity, and isolation.

AB  - The use of a nearby external microphone for addressing front-back ambiguity in single-microphone hearing aid devices is investigated. Strategic placement of the external microphone is able to provide benefits from the body shielding back-directional noise and therefore information for discriminating between the frontal and back hemispheres. The scattering effects of the body are first analyzed to yield a placement strategy of the external microphone for maximizing the shielding effect of the body against back-directional noise sources while also optimizing for speech intelligibility. Assuming optimal placement, a frontal target source presence probability (FTSPP) estimator is derived. Using the FTSPP estimator, a more comprehensive noise estimator is proposed, which considers both stationary and nonstationary interferers. The performance of the proposed noise estimator is evaluated in its application for postfiltering the output of a binaural beamformer. The effect of postfiltering using the proposed noise estimator is to provide further reduction of directional noise from the lateral and back direction while preserving the frontal target signal. The resulting enhancement with the proposed noise estimator provides a better signal-to-noise ratio and improved objective speech quality and intelligibility of a frontal target speaker compared to the state of the art.

AB  - This paper presents a 10-bit successive approximation analog-to-digital converter (ADC) that operates at an ultralow voltage of 0.3 V and can be applied to biomedical implants. The study proposes several techniques to improve the ADC performance. A pipeline comparator was utilized to maintain the advantages of dynamic comparators and reduce the kickback noise. Weight biasing calibration was used to correct the offset voltage without degrading the operating speed of the comparator. The incorporation of a unity-gain buffer improved the bootstrap switch leakage problem during the hold period and reduced the effect of parasitic capacitances on the digital-to-analog converter. The chip was fabricated using 90-nm CMOS technology. The data measured at a supply voltage of 0.3 V and sampling rate of 3 MSps for differential nonlinearity and integral nonlinearity were +0.83/-0.54 and +0.84/-0.89, respectively, and the signal-to-noise plus distortion ratio and effective number of bits were 56.42 dB and 9.08 b, respectively. The measured total power consumption was 6.6 μW at a figure of merit of 4.065 fJ/conv.-step.

AB  - The oscillator architecture is proposed to reduce the close-in phase noise as well as power consumption. The proposed Colpitts oscillator removes the current source which is the main source of the 1/f noise conversion. The removal of the current source is compensated by using the transformer and cross-coupled capacitors. The 2-GHz film bulk acoustic resonator (FBAR) is used for the high Q frequency selective elements in the oscillator design. According to measurement results, this FBAR-based oscillator shows ≥ 10 dB reduction in close-in phase noise. Specifically, 12-dB lower phase noise is achieved at 100 Hz offset frequency. Measured power consumption is 350 uW, which is almost half of the conventional Colpitts oscillator using same FBAR device.

AB  - In this brief, a multi-carrier differential chaos shift keying system capable of mitigating channel noise is proposed. In this system, subcarriers are allocated to the reference and data signals in an optimal way, while noise reduction is achieved through reference diversity. To verify its performance, the bit error rate of the proposed system over multipath Rayleigh fading channels is derived, together with a detailed discussion about the determination of the optimal number of reference-carrying subcarriers. Extensive simulations are carried out for performance evaluation, which are further compared to other state-of-the-art systems. Results confirm the superior bit error rate performance of the proposed system, which has only small loss in energy and spectral efficiencies.

AB  - This article aims at investigating the impact of harmonic current, vibration, and noise on induction motors (IMs) with a fractional order (FO) proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller. Conventional PID controllers are widely used in closed-loop vector-space to control IMs. In general, the parameters of a PID controller should be considered carefully because the vector-space loop can induce imbalanced current and magnetic flux in the α-β sub-plane closed-loop system. If this occurs, the imbalanced current affects not only the IM performance but also the harmonic current, motor vibration, and noise. In this study, an FO PID (Pp Iλ Dμ) controller is used for stabilizing the effect of the current and harmonic on the IM. This PID controller is built based on the results of measurements on motor design parameters. By using the phase margin rule to design and determine suitable parameters, several orders of p, λ, and μ in their reasonable ranges are evaluated to obtain a relative optimal FO (Pp Iλ Dμ) controller. This can improve the performance of the IM in terms of harmonic current, vibration, and noise, more than a conventional PID controller can achieve.

AB  - Experimental Self-Mixing (SM) or optical feedback interferometric signals are usually affected by additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and impulsive noise. Depending on SM sensing set-up, these noises can significantly reduce the signal to noise ratio (SNR) of SM signals which in turn affects the measurement performance of signal processing algorithms employed for metric information retrieval. In this paper, adaptive line enhancement (ALE) technique is proposed to remove AWGN and impulsive noise from SM signals. Specifically, a recursive least squares (RLS) based ALE algorithm has been designed and the results have been compared with established methods such as high-order digital low-pass filtering and discrete wavelet transform. The comparison indicates better precision in case of use of RLS-ALE even when significant variations occur in the operating optical feedback regime and remote target velocity as well as in presence of speckle. The proposed algorithm can also estimate the SNR of SM signals belonging to weak-, moderate-, and strong-optical feedback regime with SNR ranging from 0 dB to 40 dB, with a mean absolute error of 1.35 dB and a 1.09 dB precision. Statistical analysis of noise recovered from different experimental SM signals attests the Gaussian- and impulsive-nature of noise. Thus, the proposed method also enables a simple and reliable quantitative analysis and comparison of different laser diode based SM laser sensors operating under variable optical conditions.

AB  - Impulsive noise (IN) is a major component that degrades signal integrity in power line communication (PLC) systems. PLC systems driven by orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) have Rayleigh distributed amplitudes. Based on the dynamic nature of each OFDM symbol, peak amplitude of the symbol was recently shown to be a suitable threshold for detecting IN, and this technique outperforms the conventional optimal blanking (COB) scheme. In this study, we improve the dynamic peak-based threshold estimation (DPTE) scheme that relies on the OFDM Rayleigh distributed amplitudes by converting the default Rayleigh distribution to uniform distribution to unveil IN with power levels below that of the conventional peak signal. Then, we perform nonlinear mitigation processing on the received signals, whose amplitudes exceed the uniformly distributed amplitude using blanking, a scheme we will refer to as uniformly distributed DPTE (U-DPTE). Our results (based on U-DPTE) significantly outperform the DPTE scheme by up to 4-dB gain in terms of output signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Additionally and unlike earlier DPTE studies, we propose a novel threshold criterion that compensates the Gaussian noise power-level amplification (after equalization) for achieving the optimal SNR over a log-normal multipath fading channel. The results further reveal the suboptimality of the DPTE scheme over COB.

AB  - This article presents a space–time averaging technique that can realize instantaneous fractional frequency division, and thus, can significantly reduce the quantization error in a fractional- $N$  phase-locked loop (PLL). Spatial averaging can be achieved by using an array of dividers running in parallel. Their different division ratios are generated by using a fractional  $\Delta \Sigma $  modulator (DSM) and a dynamic element matching (DEM) block. To reduce the divider power, this article also proposes a way to achieve spatial averaging using only one divider and phase selection. A prototype 2.4-GHz fractional- $N$  PLL is implemented in a 40-nm CMOS process. Measurement results show that the proposed technique reduces the phase noise by 10 and 21 dB at the 1- and 10-MHz offset, respectively, leading to a reduction of the integrated rms jitter from 9.55 to 2.26 ps.

AB  - Wide bandgap semiconductor devices allow higher switching frequency and switching speed for their superior characteristics. However, the ultra-fast switching speed causes severe high dv/dt noise in power conversion systems. High dv/dt induced common mode noise deteriorates the operation of gate drivers and control circuits by capacitive coupling. Since some new-developed gate driver integrated circuits (ICs) have improved the common mode transient immunity capability, control circuits become the limit in achieving higher switching speed. This paper investigates the impact of the high dv/dt noise on the control systems of GaN inverters. An improved propagation model is derived based on a full bridge inverter, and the main paths are analyzed. According to the proposed propagation model, different high dv/dt noise reduction methods, such as the sensing methods, common mode chokes, and isolation barrier capacitance, are compared quantitatively. Sensing methods with high impedance show better performance and small isolation barrier capacitance of the power supply of gate driver ICs are significant for high dv/dt noise reduction. Simulation results are presented based on the Q3D extraction results of the investigated inverter system and a 500-W GaN-based full bridge inverter is built for experimental verification.

AB  - In multi-microphone speech enhancement, reverberation as well as additive noise and/or interfering speech are commonly suppressed by deconvolution and spatial filtering, e.g., using multi-channel linear prediction (MCLP) on the one hand and beamforming, e.g., a generalized sidelobe canceler (GSC), on the other hand. In this article, we consider several reverberant speech components, whereof some are to be dereverberated and others to be canceled, as well as a diffuse (e.g., babble) noise component to be suppressed. In order to perform both deconvolution and spatial filtering, we integrate MCLP and the GSC into a novel architecture referred to as integrated sidelobe cancellation and linear prediction (ISCLP), where the sidelobe-cancellation (SC) filter and the linear prediction (LP) filter operate in parallel, but on different microphone signal frames. Within ISCLP, we estimate both filters jointly by means of a single Kalman filter. We further propose a spectral Wiener gain post-processor, which is shown to relate to the Kalman filter's posterior state estimate. The presented ISCLP Kalman filter is benchmarked against two state-of-the-art approaches, namely first a pair of alternating Kalman filters respectively performing dereverberation and noise reduction, and second an MCLP+GSC Kalman filter cascade. While the ISCLP Kalman filter is roughly $M^2$ times less expensive than both reference algorithms, where $M$ denotes the number of microphones, it is shown to perform at least similarly as compared to the former, and to outperform the latter. A MATLAB implementation is available.

AB  - Due to the limitation of the seismic data acquisition environment and instrument, seismic data are often subjected to random noise interference. At the same time, random noise is inevitably introduced in the processing of seismic data. To solve the problem, this paper proposes a seismic data denoising approach based on bidimensional empirical mode decomposition (BEMD) and shearlet transform. In the beginning, the BEMD is used to decompose the seismic data with noise, and several intrinsic modal functions (IMFs) are obtained according to the frequency distribution from high to low. Then, the shearlet transform is applied to reduce the noise of the high-frequency IMF. Finally, the denoised high-frequency IMF component and the low-frequency IMF component are accumulated and reconstructed to achieve the noise reduction of seismic data. The proposed method was used to perform noise reduction experiments on seismic data. The results show that the proposed method performs better and can reduce the uneven deformation of seismic wavefront compared with other methods.

AB  - The main difficulty encountered in interpretation of cardiac sound is interference of noise. The contaminated noise obscures the relevant information, which are useful for recognition of heart diseases. The unwanted signals are produced mainly by lungs and surrounding environment. In this paper, a novel heart sound denoising technique has been introduced based on a combined framework of wavelet packet transform and singular value decomposition (SVD). The most informative node of the wavelet tree is selected on the criteria of mutual information measurement. Next, the coefficient corresponding to the selected node is processed by the SVD technique to suppress noisy component from heart sound signal. To justify the efficacy of the proposed technique, several experiments have been conducted with heart sound dataset, including normal and pathological cases at different signal to noise ratios. The significance of the method is validated by statistical analysis of the results. The biological information preserved in denoised heart sound signal is evaluated by the k-means clustering algorithm. The overall results show that the proposed method is superior than the baseline methods.

AB  - Photoacoustic tomography is a technique to reconstruct the image of light energy absorption distribution in tissues based on the detected photoacoustic signals. In recent years, this research field has been greatly developed, and its application range is wide, including anatomy, functionality, and molecular imaging. However, the conversion efficiency of photoacoustic effect from light to sound is quite low, which leads to the low signal-to-noise ratio of photoacoustic signal and the poor quality of reconstructed photoacoustic image. The traditional method to improve the signal-to-noise ratio of photoacoustic signals is data averaging method, but it seriously limits the imaging speed due to multiple acquisition. Without sacrificing signal fidelity and imaging speed, an empirical mode decomposition (EMD) combined with conditional mutual information de-noising algorithm for photoacoustic tomography is proposed in this paper. The simulation results and experimental results of photoacoustic signal de-noising achieve significant improvement of signal-to-noise ratio of photoacoustic signal and the enhancement of contrast of the reconstructed image. The simulation results and experimental results show that EMD combined with mutual information method improves at least 2 dB and 3 dB, respectively, more than traditional wavelet threshold method and band-pass filter. The improvement of contrast-to-noise ratio is more than 2 dB and 3 dB, respectively, more than traditional wavelet threshold method and band-pass filter.

AB  - In recent years, optical interconnection networks have been proposed in order to achieve the ultrahigh bandwidth and low latency requirements for inter/intra-chip communication. In these optical interconection networks, series of basic optical elements are employed. Via these series of optical elements, the intrinsic crosstalk noise is generated. With a large scale of these optical elements, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of an optical interconnect can be reduced by this crosstalk noise. In this paper, we utilize the adaptive power control (APC) to enhance the SNR under the crosstalk noise constraints. APC has been known to save energy and reduce power consumption. We apply this technique in one of the inter/intra-chip optical interconnect called I2CON. A new cluster design, namely the Beam cluster, is also introduced. Results have demonstrated that the APC can help to reduce crosstalk noise, hence, the overall SNR is improved. Comparison results have also indicated the further improvement of SNR in I2CON using Beam cluster when APC is applied.

AB  - In this paper, speech-distortion weighted (SDW) interframe Wiener filters (IFWFs) are investigated for single-channel noise reduction in a filter bank structure. The filters utilize a parameter μ that explicitly sets a tradeoff between noise reduction and speech distortion and have traditionally been used in multichannel applications under the term SDW multichannel Wiener filter. The application of these SDW-IFWFs relies on the estimation of interframe correlation (IFC) coefficients, and it is shown that the IFC coefficients can be more robustly estimated using a secondary higher resolution filter bank (HRFB). It is then shown how real-valued scalar gains, which are optimal in the primary filter bank, can be applied directly in the HRFB instead of the interframe filtering in the primary filter bank, which leads to a more robust noise reduction performance for any value of μ. Computing these gains is also cheaper since matrix inversions are avoided and the primary filter bank is not needed in the actual implementation. Experimental results are given that support the claims, where the proposed methods are compared to relevant reference methods using measures such as the segmental SNR and the objective PESQ.

AB  - Fixed-pattern noise seriously affects the clinical application of optical coherence tomography (OCT), especially, in the imaging of tumorous tissue. We propose a Hough transform-based fixed-pattern noise reduction (HTFPNR) method to reduce the fixed-pattern noise for optimizing imaging of tumorous tissue with OCT system. Using by the HTFPNR method, we detect and map the outline of fixed-pattern noise in the OCT images, and finally efficiently reduce the fixed-pattern noise by the longitudinal and horizontal intelligent processing procedure. We adopt the image-to-noise ratio with full information (INRfi) and the noise reduction ratio (NRR) to evaluate the outcome of fixed-pattern noise reduction ratio, respectively. The INRfi of OCT image's noise reduction of ex vivo brainstem tumor is approximate 21.92 dB. Six groups of OCT images, including three types of fixed-pattern noises, have been validated via experimental evaluation of the ex vivo gastric tumor. In the different types of fixed-pattern noise, the mean INRfis are 25.24, 23.04, and 19.35 dB, respectively. This result demonstrates that it is highly efficient and useful in fixed-pattern noise reduction. The fluctuating range of the NRR is 0.84-0.88 for three types of added noise in the OCT images. This result demonstrates that the HTFPNR method can as possible as save useful information by comparing to previous research. This proposed HTFPNR method can be used into the fixed-pattern noise reduction of OCT images in other soft biological tissue in the future.

AB  - Binaural hearing aids (HAs) can potentially perform advanced noise reduction algorithms, leading to an improvement over monaural/bilateral HAs. Due to the limited transmission capacities between the HAs and given knowledge of the complete joint noisy signal statistics, the optimal rate-constrained beamforming strategy is known from the literature. However, as these joint statistics are unknown in practice, sub-optimal strategies have been presented. In this paper, we present a unified framework to study the performance of these existing optimal and sub-optimal rate-constrained beamforming methods for binaural HAs. Moreover, we propose to use an asymmetric sequential coding scheme to estimate the joint statistics between the microphones in the two HAs. We show that under certain assumptions, this leads to sub-optimal performance in one HA but allows to obtain the truly optimal performance in the second HA. Based on the mean square error distortion measure, we evaluate the performance improvement between monaural beamforming (no communication) and the proposed scheme, as well as the optimal and the existing sub-optimal strategies in terms of the information bit-rate. The results show that the proposed method outperforms existing practical approaches in most scenarios, especially at middle rates and high rates, without having the prior knowledge of the joint statistics.

AB  - This paper presents a low power and low noise quadrature RC oscillator based on a frequency locked loop. Voltage swing control of each of the two sub-oscillators reduces the effect of 1/f noise on the accumulated jitter. In addition, the use of quadrature phases greatly relieves timing constraints of sampling operations and helps the reduction of power consumption. With a discrete-time modeling of the quadrature oscillator, noise analysis is also provided for quantitative estimation of the circuit-driven effects on the phase noise. The proposed oscillator is fabricated using 180-nm CMOS process in an active area of 0.058mm2. The measurement shows a period jitter of 0.047% and a standard deviation of 0.94% in untrimmed frequency (444.9kHz) in a wafer. The oscillator achieves a figure-of-merit of 155 dBc/Hz at 100 Hz offset frequency.

AB  - This letter presents a triple-8-shaped transformer-based complementary oscillator. It features tiny area, wide tuning range (TR), electromagnetic compatibility (EMC), and low flicker phase noise (PN), combining the merits of both LC-tank and ring oscillators. We identify that after suppressing the second-harmonic voltage by the complementary operation itself, the third-harmonic current entering the capacitive path is now the main cause of asymmetry in the rising and falling edges, leading to the 1/f noise upconversion. By tuning the capacitance ratio between gate and drain nodes of the switching transistors, it mitigates the third-harmonic voltage and introduces a specific gate-drain phase shift, reducing the 1/f3 PN. Fabricated in 22-nm FDSOI CMOS, the prototype occupies an area of 0.01 mm2 and achieves 1/3 PN corner of 70 kHz, PN of -110 dBc/Hz @1MHz and Figure-of-Merit (FoM) of -182 dB at 9 GHz, 39% TR, resulting in the best FoM with normalized TR and area (FoMTA) of -214 dB@1 MHz.

AB  - SiC devices can upgrade the inverter performance to a new level by its potentially more than ten times higher switching speed compared to its Si counterpart. However, the high switching frequency and dv/dt, di/dt worsen the electromagnetic interference. Reduction of the common mode (CM) noise of the non-isolated photovoltaic (PV) inverters is addressed by many researchers through adding filters or balancing the circuit. However, most methods rely on the certainty of the parasitics in the system in advance. It is usually not practical for a PV inverter because the parasitic capacitance of PV panels that are to be installed in plants varies from case to case and further can be seriously affected by the damp environment. This article proposes a practical way to reduce the CM noise of the three-level active neutral point clamped (ANPC) inverters with uncertain parasitic capacitance of PV panels. First, the CM model of ANPC inverters with all parasitic capacitances is established. Next, most existing hardware-based reduction methods of the CM noise are summarized based on a unified mathematical model and further compared with each other. After the comparison, a practical method is proposed to reduce the CM noise of the ANPC inverter with uncertain parasitic capacitances, which just adds little volume and cost to the whole system. Finally, the simulation and experiments are conducted to validate the proposed method.

AB  - Acoustic sensing from a multi-rotor drone is heavily degraded by the strong ego-noise produced by the rotating motors and propellers. To address this problem, we propose a blind source separation (BSS) framework that extracts a target sound from noisy multi-channel signals captured by a microphone array mounted on a drone. The proposed method addresses the challenging problem of permutation alignment, in extremely low signal-to-noise-ratio scenarios (e.g. SNR <; -15 dB), by performing clustering on the time activities of the separated signals across frequencies. Since initialization plays an important role to the success of clustering, we propose a pre-processing algorithm which uses time-frequency spatial filtering (TFS) to generate a reference to pre-align the permutation. The pre-alignment not only improves the performance of clustering and permutation alignment, but also solves the target-channel selection problem for BSS. The proposed method integrates the advantages of both TFS and BSS. Experimental results with real-recorded data show that the proposed method is capable of processing the audio stream continuously in a blockwise manner and also remarkably outperforms the state-of-the-art.

AB  - In practical applications, the signal measured from a complex mechanical system is usually disturbed by various noises due to the compounded effect of interferences of other machine elements and background noises, especially under varying speed conditions. Resonance-based approaches have been proven to be effective methods to address this problem. However, even if the optimal resonance band is accurately determined, the in-band noise with frequency content in the range covered by the band-pass filter is not eliminated. To avoid missed diagnosis and misdiagnosis of faults in bearings, an iterated SVD (ISVD)-based in-band noise reduction method combined with envelope order spectrum analysis is proposed in this paper. First, the optimal frequency band of a vibrational signal is determined with the help of an enhanced wavelet packet transform kurtogram, in which the kurtosis of each node is calculated based on the envelope spectrum of a signal be reconstructed using the wavelet packet coefficients. The node with the maximum kurtosis value is used to reconstruct the signal. Second, the envelope of a reconstructed signal is calculated by Hilbert transform and the ISVD method is applied to it to reduce the in-band noise. To avoid the destruction of useful information caused by excessive iteration, a threshold is set to determine the number of iterations. After iterative processing, a de-noised signal is reconstructed based on the relationship between the singular value and a frequency component. Finally, the reconstructed signal is resampled and transformed into the fault characteristic order domain where the bearing fault type can be identified from the envelope order spectra. The simulations and experiments were used to validate the efficacy of the proposed method. Compared with the spectral subtraction method, the ISVD method can suppress in-band noise efficiently and beneficial to extract the fault characteristic order under variable speed conditions.

AB  - Electromagnetic interference (EMI) has drawn great attention in recent years. In this particular case, it is generated by the three-phase inverters in power electronics applications due to the power devices turning on and off at high frequency. In this paper, in order to alleviate such EMI noise, a high-frequency common-mode (CM) equivalent model is developed, which leverages the effect of parasitic parameters. Meanwhile, in order to eliminate the effect of the parasitic capacitance between the phase node and ground, which is the cause of main CM noise propagation, a coupled inductor connected with a capacitor circuit, which is equivalent to a negative capacitance is proposed. The parameter calculation for the passive negative capacitance circuit is given in detail. The experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness of the circuitry structure and its ability to reduce CM noise.

AB  - This paper presents experimental investigation study of Acoustic Noise and Vibration (ANV) reduction in Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor (PMSM) drives with a novel application of `harmonics spread spectrum technique'. In order to reduce the ANV of PMSM drives, the Random Pulse Width Modulation (RPWM) method is applied which distributes the power of harmonic noise in a wide range of discrete frequency spectrum. Furthermore, in-depth theoretical analysis is presented about the way RPWM improves torque ripples, vibration and acoustic noise in PMSM drives. The theoretical and experimental results obtained are used to draw the operational concept of the power electronics converters to reduce ANV; which is produced by PMSM drive. Time and frequency-domain analysis are carried out to examine the effects of change in the operating parameters such as pulse-width, etc. of the power electronics converters on the ANV. A small-scale laboratory set-up was developed for PMSM drive with low cost acoustic chamber for experimental investigations. Experimental results show significant reduction in ANV and torque ripples of the PMSM drive with the application of RPWM technique.

AB  - In recent years, many studies have examined filters for eliminating or reducing speckle noise, which is inherent to ultrasound images, in order to improve the metrological evaluation of their biomedical applications. In the case of medical ultrasound images, said noise can produce uncertainty in the diagnosis because details, such as limits and edges, should be preserved. Most algorithms can eliminate speckle noise, but they do not consider the conservation of these details. This paper describes, in detail, 27 techniques that mainly focus on the smoothing or elimination of speckle noise in medical ultrasound images. The aim of this study is to highlight the importance of improving said smoothing and elimination, which are directly related to several processes (such as the detection of regions of interest) described in other articles examined in this study. Furthermore, the description of this collection of techniques facilitates the implementation of evaluations and research with a more specific scope. This study initially covers several classical methods, such as spatial filtering, diffusion filtering, and wavelet filtering. Subsequently, it describes recent techniques in the field of machine learning focused on deep learning, which are not yet well known but greatly relevant, along with some modern and hybrid models in the field of speckle-noise filtering. Finally, five Full-Reference (FR) distortion metrics, common in filter evaluation processes, are detailed along with a compensation methodology between FR and Non-Reference (NR) metrics, which can generate greater certainty in the classification of the filters by considering the information of their behavior in terms of perceptual quality provided by NR metrics.

AB  - An ultra-low-power (ULP) capacitive microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) accelerometer analog front-end (AFE) chip with 290-μg/√Hz noise floor and 252-nW power consumption is presented. To achieve such low-noise characteristics under ULP operation, the proposed AFE utilizes a novel circuitry scheme, namely, feedforward noise reduction technique (FNRT), which cancels some of the correlated noise. The FNRT is a simple modification of the conventional self-balancing bridge (SBB) architecture without using any extra power and it can relax the noise requirement on amplifiers in AFE, thereby reducing its power consumption. The designed system uses an SAR ADC employing a simple signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) enhancement technique and includes a finite state machine (FSM) to enable dynamic configuration and duty-cycling operation. The AFE chip is implemented in a 0.18-μm complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) process and achieves a dynamic range of 65 dB and the bias instability of 62.8 μg.

AB  - This paper presents a system that enables the passive reduction of noise and vibrations in a three-phase induction machine with a stator damper winding connected to capacitors. This is a simple and effective system for reducing the flux density harmonics in an electrical machine. The theoretical study is based on the modeling of a machine equipped with the damper winding obtained from Kron's theory about equivalent circuits of electrical machinery. The analysis of the equivalent circuit allows one to identify possibilities to reduce the flux density harmonics responsible of unwanted noise and vibration components. Finally, an experimental validation is performed.

AB  - The bitonic filter was recently developed to embody the novel concept of signal bitonicity (one local extremum within a set range) to differentiate from noise, by use of data ranking and linear operators. For processing images, the spatial extent was locally constrained to a fixed circular mask. Since structure in natural images varies, a novel structurally varying bitonic filter is presented, which locally adapts the mask, without following patterns in the noise. This new filter includes novel robust structurally varying morphological operations, with efficient implementations, and a novel formulation of non-iterative directional Gaussian filtering. Data thresholds are also integrated with the morphological operations, increasing noise reduction for low noise, and enabling a multi-resolution framework for high noise levels. The structurally varying bitonic filter is presented without presuming prior knowledge of morphological filtering, and compared to high-performance linear noise-reduction filters, to set this novel concept in context. These are tested over a wide range of noise levels, on a fairly broad set of images. The new filter is a considerable improvement on the fixed-mask bitonic, outperforms anisotropic diffusion and image-guided filtering in all but extremely low noise, non-local means at all noise levels, but not the block-matching 3D filter, though results are promising for very high noise. The structurally varying bitonic tends to have less characteristic residual noise in regions of smooth signal, and very good preservation of signal edges, though with some loss of small scale detail when compared to the block-matching 3D filter. The efficient implementation means that processing time, though slower than the fixed-mask bitonic filter, remains competitive.

AB  - Ambisonics encodes the directional information of a sound field w.r.t. a reference position in an efficient and scalable way. However, the sound field might contain undesired noise. Reducing the noise while preserving the directional distribution of all sound field components is a challenging task. Recently, the present authors proposed a direction-preserving noise reduction method for higher-order Ambisonics (HOA) signals, which, in contrast to e.g. binaural beamforming methods, yields a HOA signal at the output. In this work, we investigate the direction-preserving noise reduction method further and compare it against a beamforming-based method and the matrix multi-channel Wiener filter. Different methods to estimate the power spectral densities which are needed for the noise reduction methods are discussed. Moreover, a method to preserve the reverberation of the desired signal is proposed. In the evaluation, the discussed methods are compared for different speech sources in anechoic and reverberant conditions and different noise types.

AB  - Nonlinear interference (NLI) generated during the propagation of an optical waveform through the fiber depends on the fourth order standardized moment of the channel input distribution, also known as kurtosis. Probabilistically-shaped inputs optimized for the linear Gaussian channel have a Gaussian-like distribution with high kurtosis. For optical channels, this leads to an increase in NLI power and consequently, a decrease in effective signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In this work, we propose kurtosis-limited enumerative sphere shaping (K-ESS) as an algorithm to generate low-kurtosis shaped inputs. Numerical simulations at a shaping blocklength of 108 amplitudes demonstrate that with K-ESS, it is possible to increase the effective SNRs by 0.4 dB in a single-span single-channel scenario at 400 Gbit/s. K-ESS offers also a twofold decrease in frame error rate with respect to Gaussian-channel-optimal sphere shaping.

AB  - Nowadays, a quiet working and living environment is very important to people, therefore makers of home appliances, who tightly compete with each other, wage war on every decibel. As a result, methods of decreasing noise pollution have become a popular topic, attracting the attention of researchers. This article studies the braking of reciprocating compressors and its impact on the additional noise and vibrations at the stoppage. The manuscript explains the nature of these undesirable phenomena and proposes solutions to decrease them. The author analyzed conventional solutions and experimentally checked them. The results of these experiments proved that considered noise decreasing techniques are not applicable to the developing device, thus a new method has to be proposed. The author proposed several new techniques of compressor braking and checked them experimentally. Based on the analysis of these experiments, the method with better performance was selected for further study and improvements. The main innovation of the proposed method is the usage of exact mechanical position of the rotor to start braking and exclude reverse rotation of the piston, which produces noise. This article demonstrates that the proposed method eliminates additional noise and vibrations at the stoppage of reciprocating compressors, therefore, it is recommended for use in new motor drives. Taking into account the significant improvement of the acoustic profile of the proposed braking algorithm, it was included in the control algorithm of reciprocating compressors in mass production.

AB  - Objective: Accurate segmentation and partitioning of lesions in PET images provide computer-aided procedures and doctors with parameters for tumour diagnosis, staging and prognosis. Currently, PET segmentation and lesion partitioning are manually measured by radiologists, which is time consuming and laborious, and tedious manual procedures might lead to inaccurate measurement results. Therefore, we designed a new automatic multiprocessing scheme for PET image pre-screening, noise reduction, segmentation and lesion partitioning in this study. PET image pre-screening can reduce the time cost of noise reduction, segmentation and lesion partitioning methods, and denoising can enhance both quantitative metrics and visual quality for better segmentation accuracy. For pre-screening, we propose a new differential activation filter (DAF) to screen the lesion images from whole-body scanning. For noise reduction, neural network inverse (NN inverse) as the inverse transformation of generalized Anscombe transformation (GAT), which does not depend on the distribution of residual noise, was presented to improve the SNR of images. For segmentation and lesion partitioning, definition density peak clustering (DDPC) was proposed to realize instance segmentation of lesion and normal tissue with unsupervised images, which helped reduce the cost of density calculation and completely deleted the cluster halo. The experimental results of clinical data demonstrate that our proposed methods have good results and better performance in noise reduction, segmentation and lesion partitioning compared with state-of-the-art methods.

AB  - This article presents a discrete-time secondorder ΔΣ modulator for the audio applications. In this modulator, a novel dynamic amplifier is proposed to realize the switched-capacitor (SC) integrators. To eliminate the common-mode (CM) voltage drop in a closed-loop dynamic amplifier during the integration phase, without the use of additional load capacitance, the reset method for the amplifier is modified. Two auxiliary branches are introduced to enhance the settling speed of the integrator. Two different flicker noise reduction techniques (FNRTs) are developed to improve the signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio (SNDR) (about 2 dB in the audio bandwidth). The prototype modulator is fabricated in 65-nm CMOS technology with a 0.12-mm2 core area, which achieves a dynamic range (DR) of 91 dB and a peak SNDR of 89.6 dB in the 24-kHz signal bandwidth. It consumes only 49-μW power from a 0.8-V supply, translating into a Schreier figure of merit (FoM) of 176.5 dB.

AB  - This paper presents a fast-settling, low-power, lownoise real-time clock (RTC) generator for a 4.194304-MHz crystal oscillator. The fast settling reduces the startup time of the proposed RTC generator using a negative transcondutance booster and a crystal energy booster. The low power is only operated to reduce the total power consumption in the standby mode with the use of a peak-and-low detector. To achieve the electromagnetic interference (EMI) reduction, a pseudorandom number generator is used. The temperature compensation reduces the frequency offset from 16 to 1 ppm depending on the temperature variation. The proposed RTC generator is fabricated using a 0.18-μm CMOS and the core area is 0.4 mm × 0.7 mm. The power consumption is 54 μW from a 1.8-V supply voltage. The measured startup time can be reduced by 90% from 4 ms to 400 μs with the proposed 4.194304-MHz XTAL driver. The current consumption in the standby mode is reduced by up to 700 nA. The measured frequency variation is up to a 1-ppm operation under a temperature change from -40 °C to 60 °C. The measured output peak power is reduced by up to 15 dB in the EMI reduction mode.

AB  - This work proposes a new theory to reduce the phase noise of K-band Voltage-Controlled Oscillators (VCOs) in Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) process by introducing one or more transmission poles around the parallel resonance of an LC-tank circuit. Introduction of transmission poles beside the parallel resonance of the LC-tank circuit sharpens the skirt characteristics of the Scattering ( $\vert \text{S}\vert$ ) parameters of the resonators. In return, sharp  $\vert \text{S}\vert $ -parameters slope enhances the resonator loaded quality (Q) factor without compromising the unloaded Q-factor. In addition, the transmission pole can be realized near the second harmonic of the oscillation. This allocation of the transmission pole leads to the cancellation of this second harmonic and a further reduction of the phase noise. The proposed theory is verified by three different designs based on defected ground structure (DGS) resonators. These designs realized a low-band transmission pole before the parallel resonance, a high-band transmission pole after the parallel resonance, and dual-band transmission poles around the parallel resonance. First, each design is verified and compared to the others using circuit and electromagnetic simulations to establish the Q-factor improvement. Then, each of the resonators is utilized in a differential VCO topology and the phase noise reduction in post-layout simulations is confirmed. Finally, two chips are fabricated in 0.18- $\mu $  m CMOS technology and measured. The measurement results are in good agreement with the simulations, which confirm our claim about the proposed theory.

AB  - In wireless ultraviolet optical communications, noise is one of the most essential factors affecting the communication system performance. This paper presents a scheme of reducing noise in the received ultraviolet signal using wavelet transform algorithms. An effective signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) calculation method for the received signals is also proposed, and adopted by our wavelet denoising scheme so that an optimal wavelet basis function can be selected. The proposed denoising method is applied to both the ultraviolet signals generated from the multi-scattering transmission simulation model and the signals received from physical experiments, under different conditions of transceiver elevation angles and communication distances. The results show consistently that the wavelet transform algorithm can significantly improve the SNRs at the receiving end. When the wavelet basis is coif2, the best denoising effect is achieved where the improved SNR reaches 11.9925 dB on average for various physical conditions.

AB  - State-of-the-art hearing aids (HAs) try to overcome the deficit of poor speech intelligibility (SI) in noisy listening environments using digital noise reduction (NR) techniques. The application of time-frequency masks to the noisy sound input is a common NR technique to increase SI. The binary mask with its binary weights and the Wiener filter with continuous weights are representatives of a hard- and a soft-decision approach for time-frequency masking. In normal-hearing listeners, the ideal Wiener filter (IWF) outperforms the ideal binary mask (IBM) in terms of SI and speech quality with perfect SI even at very low signal-to-noise ratios. In this paper, both approaches were investigated for hearing-impaired (HI) listeners. Perceptual and auditory model-based measures were used for the evaluation. The IWF outperformed the IBM in terms of SI. Quality-wise, there was no overall difference between the NR algorithms perceived. Additionally, the processed signals were evaluated based on an auditory nerve model using the neurogram similarity metric (NSIM). The mean NSIM values were significantly different for intelligible and unintelligible sentences. The results suggest that a soft-mask seems to be promising for application in HAs.

AB  - We consider the problem of simultaneous reduction of acoustic echo, reverberation and noise. In real scenarios, these distortion sources may occur simultaneously and reducing them implies combining the corresponding distortion-specific filters. As these filters interact with each other, they must be jointly optimized. We propose to model the target and residual signals after linear echo cancellation and dereverberation using a multichannel Gaussian modeling framework and to jointly represent their spectra by means of a neural network. We develop an iterative block-coordinate ascent algorithm to update all the filters. We evaluate our system on real recordings of acoustic echo, reverberation and noise acquired with a smart speaker in various situations. The proposed approach outperforms in terms of overall distortion a cascade of the individual approaches and a joint reduction approach which does not rely on a spectral model of the target and residual signals.

AB  - This paper addresses the problems of blind multichannel identification and equalization for joint speech dereverberation and noise reduction. The time-domain cross-relation method is hardly applicable for blind room impulse response identification due to the near-common zeros of the long impulse responses. We extend the cross-relation method to the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) domain, in which the time-domain impulse response is approximately represented by the convolutive transfer function (CTF) with much less coefficients. For the oversampled STFT, CTFs suffer from the common zeros caused by the nonflat frequency response of the STFT window. To overcome this, we propose to identify CTFs using the STFT framework with oversampled signals and critically sampled CTFs, which is a good tradeoff between the frequency aliasing of the signals and the common zeros problem of CTFs. The identified complex-valued CTFs are not accurate enough for multichannel equalization due to the frequency aliasing of the CTFs. Hence, we only use the CTF magnitudes, which leads to a nonnegative multichannel equalization method based on a nonnegative convolution model between the STFT magnitude of the source signal and the CTF magnitude. Compared with the complex-valued convolution model, this nonnegative convolution model is shown to be more robust against the CTF perturbations. To recover the STFT magnitude of the source signal and to reduce the additive noise, the l2 -norm fitting error between the STFT magnitude of the microphone signals and the nonnegative convolution is constrained to be less than a noise power related tolerance. Meanwhile, the l1 -norm of the STFT magnitude of the source signal is minimized to impose the sparsity.

AB  - Porous materials are frequently used for noise reduction in acoustical applications with air. These types of materials lose their absorbing capacity when saturated by liquids. To reduce the underwater noise radiated by ships, metallic foams are specifically designed for acoustical dissipation when saturated by diesel, to use them as a covering in the interior of fuel tanks. The aim is to attract and dissipate noise in the fuel tanks by means of the diesel-foam viscous coupling. For this aim, analytical solutions of the reflection, absorption, and transmission coefficients have been developed. The interior covering of the tank wall with the metallic foam could produce reductions of transmitted sound to the ocean over 10 dB if the metallic foam is properly designed.

AB  - The traditional interferometric synthetic aperture radar denoising methods normally try to estimate the phase fringes directly from the noisy interferogram. Since the statistics of phase noise are more stable than the phase corresponding to complex terrain, it could be easier to estimate the phase noise. In this article, phase noises rather than phase fringes are estimated first, and then they are subtracted from the noisy interferometric phase for denoising. The denoising convolutional neural network is introduced to estimate the phase noise and then a modified network called IPDnCNN is constructed for the problem. Based on the IPDnCNN, a novel interferometric phase noise reduction algorithm is proposed, which can reduce the phase noise while protecting fringe edges and avoid the use of filter windows. The experimental results using the simulated and real data are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB  - Speckle noise is the main cause of poor optical coherence tomography (OCT) image quality. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown remarkable performances for speckle noise reduction. However, speckle noise denoising still meets great challenges because the deep learning-based methods need a large amount of labeled data whose acquisition is time-consuming or expensive. Besides, many CNNs-based methods design complex structure based networks with lots of parameters to improve the denoising performance, which consume hardware resources severely and are prone to overfitting. To solve these problems, we propose a novel semi-supervised learning based method for speckle noise denoising in retinal OCT images. First, to improve the model's ability to capture complex and sparse features in OCT images, and avoid the problem of a great increase of parameters, a novel capsule conditional generative adversarial network (Caps-cGAN) with small number of parameters is proposed to construct the semi-supervised learning system. Then, to tackle the problem of retinal structure information loss in OCT images caused by lack of detailed guidance during unsupervised learning, a novel joint semi-supervised loss function composed of unsupervised loss and supervised loss is proposed to train the model. Compared with other state-of-the-art methods, the proposed semi-supervised method is suitable for retinal OCT images collected from different OCT devices and can achieve better performance even only using half of the training data.

AB  - The attitude stabilization of flexible spacecraft is significantly affected by environmental disturbances, elastic vibration of flexible appendages, and model uncertainties. These disturbances and uncertainties can be accurately estimated by the extended disturbance observer (EDO). However, the EDO is sensitive to measurement noise when high-order and large bandwidth are chosen. Thus, the output of the EDO will contain too much high-frequency noise which can degrade the attitude stability of the spacecraft and cause heavier chattering of the actuators. In order to suppress the effect of measurement noise, a noise reduction EDO (NREDO) is proposed in this paper. First, a dynamical model of disturbance is reconstructed by augmenting the integral of the virtual measurement of the lumped disturbance as a new state. Second, the NREDO is designed by utilizing the estimation error of the augmented state to update the observer estimates. Thereafter, the disturbance estimation accuracy is analyzed for the EDO and NREDO in the frequency domain in the presence of measurement noises. Finally, the simulations are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed controller. The theoretical analysis and simulation results demonstrated that the NREDO can not only effectively suppress the effect of measurement noise, but also inherit the advantages of the EDO in avoiding redundant estimation of the system states and dealing with the nonlinear item of the spacecraft model. Improved attitude control performance can be achieved under the proposed NREDO-based controller.

AB  - This paper proposes a balanced feedforward current-sense current-compensation (CSCC) common-mode (CM) active electromagnetic interference (EMI) filter (AEF). The advantages of the feedforward CSCC-type AEF are theoretically demonstrated. The operation of the proposed AEF is completely analyzed, and practical design guidelines are developed regarding performance and stability. The proposed AEF is applied to an L-C-L EMI filter for a 2.2 kW resonant inverter, and CM noises are further reduced by 3 to 18 dB from 150 kHz to 10 MHz. The problem of CM-to-differential mode noise transformation due to an unbalanced AEF structure is also investigated by the measurements using a vector network analyzer.

AB  - Filter capacitors are among the most serious noise sources in HVDC converter stations, and there are still no satisfactory noise reduction measures. This paper proposes the use of the mass tuning (MT) method to adjust the vibration frequency response characteristics and to realize vibration control and noise reduction. First, the theoretical model of the MT structure is developed based on continuum mechanics. Based on the theoretical model, it is revealed that inserting an MT component into the capacitor element package will cause a decrease in the resonant frequencies and antiresonant frequencies. Furthermore, the movement degree of the resonant frequencies increases as the position of the MT component becomes closer to the package end, while the movement degree of the antiresonant frequency is the largest when the MT component is located in the middle of the package model. The vibrations and the noise levels of an example MT capacitor are then compared with the results of an original capacitor. The comparison results show that the MT scheme designed in this paper can achieve a noise reduction effect of 12-15 dB(A). The proposed reduction method is proven to be both effective and efficient.

AB  - In this brief, we propose an active mixer based on a modified Gilbert-cell topology intended for radar applications, which uses an LO waveform shaper at mm-wave frequencies to decrease the high 1/f noise of MOS transistors. Compared to a reference mixer without an LO waveform shaper, measurement results show that this mixer achieves a significant 5 dB noise figure (NF) reduction at 100 kHz. The measured voltage conversion gain (CG) and input-referred 1-dB compression point (IP1dB) are 2 dB and -4 dBm, respectively. The core of the proposed modified Gilbert-cell draws 13 mA from a single 0.9-V supply, while it occupies an area of 0.5 mm × 0.94 mm. Additionally, an IF buffer drawing 12 mA has been added to drive a 50 Ω load for measurement purposes. To the best of author's knowledge, we apply the principle of switched biasing for 1/f noise reduction of an active mixer at mm-wave frequencies for the first time.

AB  - Ultrasound vascular imaging based on ultrafast plane wave imaging and singular value decomposition (SVD) clutter filtering has demonstrated superior sensitivity in blood flow detection. However, ultrafast ultrasound vascular imaging is susceptible to electronic noise due to the weak penetration of unfocused waves, leading to a lower signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at larger depths. In addition, incoherent clutter artifacts originating from strong and moving tissue scatterers that cannot be completely removed create a strong mask on top of the blood signal that obscures the vessels. Herein, a method that can simultaneously suppress the background noise and incoherent artifacts is proposed. The method divides the tilted plane or diverging waves into two subgroups. Coherent spatial compounding is performed within each subgroup, resulting in two compounded data sets. An SVD-based clutter filter is applied to each data set, followed by a correlation between the two data sets to produce a vascular image. Uncorrelated noise and incoherent artifacts can be effectively suppressed with the correlation process, while the coherent blood signal can be preserved. The method was evaluated in wire-target simulations and phantom, in which around 7-10-dB SNR improvement was shown. Consistent results were found in a flow channel phantom with improved SNR by the proposed method (39.9 ± 0.2 dB) against conventional power Doppler (29.1 ± 0.6 dB). Last, we demonstrated the effectiveness of the method combined with block-wise SVD clutter filtering in a human liver, breast tumor, and inflammatory bowel disease data sets. The improved blood flow visualization may facilitate more reliable small vessel imaging for a wide range of clinical applications, such as cancer and inflammatory diseases.

AB  - Wireless acoustic sensor networks (WASNs) can be used for centralized multi-microphone noise reduction, where the processing is done in a fusion center (FC). To perform the noise reduction, the data needs to be transmitted to the FC. Considering the limited battery life of the devices in a WASN, the total data rate at which the FC can communicate with the different network devices should be constrained. In this article, we propose a rate-constrained multi-microphone noise reduction algorithm, which jointly finds the best rate allocation and estimation weights for the microphones across all frequencies. The optimal linear estimators are found to be the quantized Wiener filters, and the rates are the solutions to a filter-dependent reverse water-filling problem. The performance of the proposed framework is evaluated using simulations in terms of mean square error and predicted speech intelligibility. The results show that the proposed method is very close in performance to that of the existing optimal method based on discrete optimization. However, the proposed approach can do this at a much lower complexity, while the existing optimal reference method needs a non-tractable exhaustive search to find the best rate allocation across microphones.

AB  - In navigation work, the geomagnetic sensor signal is susceptible to interference, so the calibration process is necessary to compensate sensor model error. However, we found the noise error in the geomagnetic sensor leads to a considerable calculation error in the calibration coefficient matrix, which is a big obstacle in obtaining the accurate signal. To improve the calibration effect, this paper analysis the characteristic of geomagnetic sensor's noise error, and then proposes the improved Hilbert-Huang transform (IHHT) algorithm to preprocessing these noise before calibration. IHHT creatively proposes an attention Hilbert spectrum, which is robust to strong noise recognition and localization. The adaptive median filtering is employed on strong noise regions. Additionally, a similarity criterion for Intrinsic Mode Function (IMF) processing is presented to save computational resources and time. Confirmed by simulation, IHHT algorithm depresses noise to be close to 0 mGuass, and declines sample variance to 13.963 mGuass2, which shows effective noise reduction capability. The experiment result shows IHHT algorithm considerably enhances calibration performance, as the calibration error drops by more than 50% compared with the results using state-of-the-art methods.

Especially in the field of aerial remote sensing, the emergence of UAV technology has enabled the geographical information of remote areas that are not concerned to be quickly presented. However, UAV aerial photography is greatly affected by the weather. Pictures that use aerial drones for aerial photography in rainy weather will appear noise. In this paper, how to eliminate the noise of aerial image is to be talked, the multi-channel pruning technology is used to pruning the RnResNet network. Based on this, a new anti-convergence-convolution neural network noise reduction system for the operation of UAV airborne embedded equipment is proposed. The system is used to eliminate noise in the aerial image. This type of noise reducer has got rid of the current situation that the neural network noise reducer consumes too much power and is inefficient, and has certain advantages.

AB  - For blind speech dereverberation, two frameworks are commonly used: on the one hand, the multi-channel linear prediction (MCLP) framework, and on the other hand, data-dependent beamforming, e.g., the generalized sidelobe canceler (GSC) framework. The MCLP framework is designed to perform deconvolution and hence has gained increased prominence in blind speech dereverberation. The GSC framework is commonly used for noise reduction, but may be applied for dereverberation as well. In previous work, we have shown that for the noiseless case, MCLP and the GSC yield in theory mathematically equivalent results in terms of dereverberation. In this paper, we assume additional coherent as well as incoherent-noise components and formally analyze and compare both frameworks in terms of dereverberation and noise reduction performance. Both the theoretical analysis and time domain simulation results demonstrate that unlike the GSC, MCLP expectably shows limited performance in terms of noise reduction, while both perform equally well in terms of dereverberation, provided that the GSC blocking matrix achieves complete blocking of the early reverberant-speech component and sufficiently many microphones are available. In case of incomplete blocking, however, the GSC performs inferior to MCLP in terms of dereverberation, as shown in short-time Fourier transform domain simulations.

AB  - A flying drone provides multiple video capturing options for filming videos. Since a noise is generated by the propellers and rotors of a drone, the quality of sound in the recorded video is quite low. Large drones are used singly in missions while small ones are used in formations or swarms. The small drones are proving to be useful in civilian applications. These are effective with multiple drones. Consideration of small drones for the applications, such as group flight, entertainment, and signal emission lead to deployment of networked drones. To solve the noise problem and develop group display applications, a software platform for these issues in networked drones is proposed. Noise reduction combines the active noise control and spectral subtraction. In addition, drones form group displays for an entertainment and displaying application. We develop a small-scale testbed to measure the service quality of proposed platform. The experimental results show that the proposed noise reduction produces a speech signal with up to 67.5% similarity to the original signal. It outperforms active noise control and spectral subtraction with the similarities of 53.1% and 39.6%, respectively. We see that drone formation can form a group display to show messages effectively.

AB  - Due to its noninvasive character, optical coherence tomography (OCT) has become a popular diagnostic method in clinical settings. However, the low-coherence interferometric imaging procedure is inevitably contaminated by heavy speckle noise, which impairs both visual quality and diagnosis of various ocular diseases. Although deep learning has been applied for image denoising and achieved promising results, the lack of well-registered clean and noisy image pairs makes it impractical for supervised learning-based approaches to achieve satisfactory OCT image denoising results. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised OCT image speckle reduction algorithm that does not rely on well-registered image pairs. Specifically, by employing the ideas of disentangled representation and generative adversarial network, the proposed method first disentangles the noisy image into content and noise spaces by corresponding encoders. Then, the generator is used to predict the denoised OCT image with the extracted content features. In addition, the noise patches cropped from the noisy image are utilized to facilitate more accurate disentanglement. Extensive experiments have been conducted, and the results suggest that our proposed method is superior to the classic methods and demonstrates competitive performance to several recently proposed learning-based approaches in both quantitative and qualitative aspects.

AB  - To satisfy the ever-increasing requirement from load side and improve the power quality through harmonic content reduction, the paralleled converters' structure is seen to be an interesting solution. However, paralleled converters, in which the same dc and ac sides are shared, suffer from a major challenge related to the excessive circulating currents due to the difference in the induced common-mode voltage (CMV) in each converter. This voltage difference is due to the instantaneous potential difference between paralleled phase-legs, due to the discrepancy in circuit and control parameters of paralleled converters. Consequently, zero-sequence circulating current (ZSCC) as well as differential-mode circulating current (DMCC) shall appear between the paralleled converters. In this context, this article utilizes the interleaved pulsewidth modulation (PWM) concept for the ZSCC and DMCC reduction in paralleled split-source inverters (SSIs), where this SSI is a single-stage dc-ac converter and the prior mentioned operation and associated issues have not been investigated yet. This article describes the three-phase SSI structure and its basic operation, and shows the corresponding CMV waveform. Then, based on the shown analysis, an interleaved discontinuous PWM strategy is proposed to restrain the CMV amplitude and reduce the induced circulating currents. Furthermore, the effect of changing the modulation index and interleaving angle on the overall converter behavior has also been evaluated in case of using SSI. The analysis and simulations revealed the effectiveness of the proposed modulation strategy compared to counterparts. Finally, the shown simulation results are validated with an experimental prototype of 1 kW.

AB  - Compared to monaural hearing aids (HAs), binaural hearing aid systems, in which there is a communication link between the two devices, have improved noise reduction capabilities and the ability to preserve binaural spatial information. However, the limited HA battery lifetime puts constraints on the amount of information that can be shared between the two devices. In other words, the rate of transmission between the devices is an important constraint that needs to be considered, while preserving the spatial information. In this article, a linearly constrained noise reduction problem is proposed, which jointly finds the optimal rate allocation and the optimal estimation (beamforming) weights across all sensors and frequencies, while preserving the binaural spatial cues of point sources. The proposed method considers a rate constraint together with linear constraints to preserve the binaural spatial cues of point sources. Minimizing the mean square error on the estimated target speech at the left and the right side beamformers, the optimal weights are found to be rate-constrained linearly constrained minimum variance (LCMV) filters, and the optimal rates are found to be the solutions to a set of reverse water filling problems. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated using the averaged binaural signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the interaural level difference (ILD) error and the interaural time difference (ITD) error. The results show that the proposed method outperforms spatially correct noise reduction approaches that use naive/random rate allocation strategies.

AB  - Calibration and validation have long been a significant topic in traffic model development. In fact, when moving to dynamic traffic assignment (DTA) models, the need to dynamically update the demand and supply components creates a considerable burden on the existing calibration algorithms, often rendering them impractical. These calibration approaches are mostly restricted either due to non-linearity or increasing problem dimensionality. Simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA) has been proposed for the DTA model calibration, with encouraging results, for more than a decade. However, it often fails to converge reasonably with the increase in problem size and complexity. In this paper, we combine SPSA with principal components analysis (PCA) to form a new algorithm, we call, PC–SPSA. The PCA limits the search area of SPSA within the structural relationships captured from historical estimates in lower dimensions, reducing the problem size and complexity. We formulate the algorithm, demonstrate its operation, and explore its performance using an urban network of Vitoria, Spain. The practical issues that emerge from the scale of different variables and bounding their values are also analyzed through a sensitivity analysis using a non-linear synthetic function.

AB  - Recently, a contactless method for measuring a biological signal using a video camera has garnered attention. Especially, video plethysmography, a technique for obtaining a pulse wave from a video, is useful for managing the health of people on a daily basis. However, any body movement of a person subjected to the measurement leads to the generation of irregular noise in video plethysmography and reduces the accuracy of the recorded biological information, e.g., heart rate, during the measurement. Blind source separation is a popular technique for eliminating noise from the results of video plethysmography comprising different multiple-color channels. However, it is difficult to apply this technique to a single-color video such as a near-infrared video. Herein, a new method that combines singular spectrum analysis with the circular autocorrelation function is introduced to eliminate irregular noise in single-color video plethysmography. Applying the proposed method on videos collected from 39 individuals improved the estimation accuracy of instantaneous heart rate by approximately 44% over a conventional method using a linear filter. Furthermore, the proposed method also enabled more precise estimations of the heart rate than that achieved using multi-color video plethysmography.

AB  - In this paper, we investigate noise reduction in swept-source optical coherence tomography (OCT) using compressed sensing (CS). Multiple scan averaging is a classical method used to enhance the quality of OCT images by reducing the noise of a system. However, the conventional averaging method requires a repetitive scan at the same location and thus reduces the imaging speed. In this paper, the sparsity property of an OCT A-scan is utilized, and one full A-scan OCT image can be reconstructed from a portion of the acquired data during one sweep period using CS. Thus, multiple OCT A-scans can be reconstructed from a single sweep. The average A-scans yield a better quality than the single A-scan obtained from the whole data acquired during a sweep period. We demonstrate that the average of five reconstructed A-scans from a single sweep using CS offers an image quality and depth resolution similar to those obtained by averaging three sequential A-scans from three sweeps using the conventional averaging method. This proposed method can shorten the time required to perform repetitive scans and thus improve the imaging speed.

AB  - Single section quantum dash (QDash) mode locked lasers (MLL) can provide a flat and broadband optical frequency comb with low energy consumption, operational simplicity and large-scale low-cost production possibilities. MLL longitudinal modes can be employed as single carriers with a regular spectral spacing in a dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM) link, making them promising components for next generation DWDM transceivers. However, individual modes of a MLL suffer from relatively high phase noise while high capacity coherent transmission requires carriers with low phase noise. Optical feedback, which is a well-known method to reduce the linewidth of a single mode laser, can be used to stabilize comb lasers. This article reports on the investigation of phase noise properties of comb lines delivered from a single section QDash MLL under optical feedback and shows that each MLL longitudinal mode optical linewidth can be drastically narrowed. It enables coherent transmission with extended link budget over 50 km at Tbit/s line rates.

AB  - Delta-sigma modulation-based fractional-N frequency synthesizers generally suffer from quantization noise, which causes them to exhibit poor phase-noise performance outside their loop bandwidth. In this work, a self-injection locking (SIL) loop is utilized in a fractional-N frequency synthesizer. The SIL loop can reduce the noise that is generated by the injection-locked oscillator (ILO), the reference signal, and the delta-sigma modulator, greatly improving the phase-noise performance of the fractional-N frequency synthesizer. Experimental results demonstrate that the phase noise in the developed 2.4-GHz fractional-N frequency synthesizer is reduced by up to 36.5 dB using a 17-ns SIL loop. This great reduction of phase noise enables the developed synthesizer to have a very low phase noise of -110, -136, and -145 dBc/Hz at the offset frequencies of 100 kHz, 1 MHz, and 10 MHz, respectively.

AB  - This study presents the analysis and reduction of vertical crosstalk in mixed-signal 3-D integrated circuits (3-D ICs) with multilayer graphene nanoribbon (MLGNR) and multiwall carbon nanotube (MWCNT) interconnects. The 14-nm technology node is considered for both digital and analog tiers. The assessments are conducted regarding the scattering parameters (S-parameters) for the equivalent circuit model of the transmission lines using the Advanced Design System (ADS) tool. Our studies demonstrate that the MLGNR transmission lines lead to lower mismatch, insertion loss, and vertical crosstalk than their MWCNT counterparts. The results show that using MLGNR improves the area overhead by more than 67% for analog and digital wires. Moreover, our model shows that the vertical noise between the analog and digital tiers is reduced by 1 and 1.62 dB when the intermediate substrate thickness increases from 20 to 30 and 40 μm. The results demonstrate that the perpendicular routing of the MLGNR interconnects reduces the vertical noise by 6.1 dB. Moreover, a 9.21-dB reduction in the vertical coupling is achieved using vertical MLGNRs in the analog IC. Our results also show that using graphene as a shield between the analog and digital chips significantly suppresses the vertical noise between the tiers, and it becomes more effective by increasing the number of graphene layers. According to our results, using one-, two-, and three-layer graphene-shield layers reduces the vertical crosstalk by 10.1, 14.9, and 19.2 dB, respectively. Moreover, the HSPICE simulations demonstrate that the MLGNR interconnects have a lower delay, power, and energy consumption than their MWCNT counterparts in the 3-D mixed-signal architecture.

AB  - Multifrequency phase-sensitive demodulation (PSD) plays an important role in electrical impedance tomography (EIT). In the presence of Gaussian noise, multifrequency PSD can be regarded as a matched filter and an optimal linear filter for the acquired signal. However, the additive noise often has the characteristics of impulsive noise in a real measurement system. Thus, it is a challenging task to reduce the impulsive noise effectively in multifrequency PSD. Considering the periodicity of multifrequency signal and the significant properties of 2-D median filter (MF), a method for impulsive noise reduction in multifrequency PSD of EIT was proposed in this paper. This paper mainly focused on reducing the impulsive noise by using the characteristics of signal itself and the 2-D MF. Numerical simulations and experiments were set up to verify the proposed method. Both results demonstrated that the proposed method can reduce the impulsive noise in multifrequency PSD effectively, and it can also provide demodulation information with higher signal-to-noise ratio and stronger robustness.

AB  - The topic of denoising magnetic resonance (MR) images is considered in this paper. More in detail, an enhanced Non-Local Means (NLM) filter using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) distance is proposed. The KS-NLM approach estimates the similarity between image patches by computing the KS distance. To overcome that NLM filters assign the same role to all pixels in patches, that is, not privileging the central one, we propose a new filter, namely the Anisotropic Weighted KS-NLM (Aw KS-NLM), which better deals with central pixels within the patches by, on one hand, including a suitable weighted strategy and, on the other, by performing a local anisotropy analysis. The Aw KS-NLM has been compared to other existing non-local Means (NLM) methodologies in both MRI simulated and real datasets. The results provide excellent noise reduction and image-detail preservation.

AB  - Electrocardiogram (ECG) is a critical biological signal, which usually carries a great deal of essential information about patients. The high quality ECG signals are always required for a proper diagnosis of cardiac disorders. However, the raw ECG signals are highly noisy in nature. In the paper, we propose a hybrid denoising scheme to enhance ECG signals by combining high-order synchrosqueezing transform (FSSTH) with non-local means (NLM). With this method, a noisy ECG signal is first decomposed into an ensemble of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) by FSSTH. Then, some noise is removed by eliminating a set of noisy IMFs that are determined by a scaling exponent obtained by the detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA); while the remaining IMFs are filtered by NLM. Finally, the denoised ECG signal is obtained by reconstructing the processed IMFs. Experiments are carried out using the simulated ECG signals and real ones from the MIT-BIH database, and the denoising performances are evaluated in terms of signal to noise ratio (SNR), root mean squared error (RMSE) and percent root mean square difference (PRD). Results show that the hybrid denoising scheme involving both FSSTH and NLM is able to suppress complex noise from ECG signals more effectively while preserving the details well.

AB  - To improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of vibration location information in Φ-OTDR system, a variable step size normalized least mean square (VSS-NLMS) denoising method is proposed in the article. First, the mathematical principle of VSS-NLMS method is established. The method can adaptively filter the input signal and adjust the parameters. It can also update the step factor adaptively. The simulation results show that the SNR of this method is improved from -1.16 dB to 12.01 dB. Second, a heterodyne coherent optical system is built. After the detected beat signal is demodulated by I/Q quadrature demodulation, the amplitude signal and phase signal of the Rayleigh backscattered light are acquired. The amplitude signal determines the location information and the phase signal determines the vibration signal. Finally, the wavelet denoising method, the empirical mode decomposition soft threshold (EMD-soft) denoising method and the variational mode decomposition nonlinear wavelet threshold (VMD-NWT) denoising method are compared with the VSS-NLMS denoising method in the experiment. The experimental results show that the location information SNR of the VSS-NLMS denoising method is improved to 59.31 dB, 46.81 dB, 50.14 dB, 34.00 dB and 67.09 dB for 5 groups of 100 Hz - 500 Hz vibration events at the location of the 10.14 km sensing fiber. At the same time, the vibration signals of 5 groups are demodulated. This method has laid a foundation for the application of oil and gas pipelines.

AB  - Most conventional continuous wave (CW) vital sign sensors suffer from the phase noise of the voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO). This work develops a novel wireless-frequency-locked-loop (FLL)-based sensor to overcome this issue. This technology uses the propagation delay of the sensor signal to make the entire sensing circuit and the subject under test (SUT) a wireless FLL. The wireless FLL uses a quadrature-tracking technique to track the phase of the propagation signal and the phase variation that is caused by the vibration of the SUT. This technique thus enables the wireless FLL not only to reduce the phase noise of the VCO but also to sense the vital signs of the SUT. Moreover, the phase-noise reduction of the wireless FLL increases with the sensing distance. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the proposed wireless-FLL-based sensor in vital sign sensing is therefore much higher than that of a conventional CW sensor. The SNR performance of the wireless-FLL-based sensor is further optimized using a highly sensitive VCO. Experimental results demonstrate that the SNR of the wireless-FLL-based sensor is around 16 dB better than that of the conventional CW sensor at a detection distance of 4 m. The SNR enhancement increased by approximately 6.6 dB when the detection distance is doubled. With this SNR enhancement, the heart-rate measurement accuracy of the developed 2.4 GHz wireless-FLL-based sensor is 90.5 % at a detection distance of 8 m.

AB  - A fully integrated micro-electromechanical system (MEMS) accelerometer with extremely low noise level (22 ng/√Hz) and sufficiently low power consumption (17 mW) for emerging applications (such as infrastructure monitoring and next-generation oil and gas exploration) was developed. By applying concurrent operations of detection and control (enabled by a unique MEMS element) and reducing servo-signal leakage and noise caused by an interaction of 1-bit quantization and asymmetric mass deformation in the digital domain, a ninefold-lower noise level is achieved in comparison with state-of-the-art low-noise low-power MEMS accelerometers. The MEMS element was fabricated on 6-in Si/SOI/Si bonding wafers, while the detection and driver integrated circuits were fabricated as interface circuits with the standard 0.13-μm complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) process and the high-voltage 0.35-μm CMOS process, respectively. The power consumption of the developed MEMS accelerometer is 17 mW from 1.4-, 1.8-, and 12-V supplies, and it has an input range of ±0.55 g and bandwidth of 400 Hz.

AB  - Harmonics and conducted electromagnetic interference (EMI) are two main issues in grid-connected inverter system. In this article, a modified LCL-LC harmonic filter is structured to strengthen its EMI suppression ability. Considering the common mode and differential mode EMI propagation paths, the traditional LCL-LC filter is split into a symmetrical topology, and with the midpoint of the split filtering capacitors connected to the midpoint of the dc-link capacitor. Compared to the traditional LCL-LC filter, the modified one can maintain the satisfied harmonic attenuation ability and strengthen the EMI suppression. Also, a double closed-loop control strategy is employed to solve the severe resonance problem caused by the harmonic filter. Moreover, a system calibration method is proposed and introduced to design the controller parameters to improve the high-order grid-connected system's stability. A comprehensive analysis and discussions concerning the traditional and modified LCL-LC filters are conducted in simulation and experiment on a 2 kW/220 V/50 Hz single-phase grid-connected inverter. The results have verified the feasibility of the proposed design method, and shown the superiority of the modified LCL-LC filter and active damping strategy in EMI mitigation. Besides, the weight and volume of the harmonic filter can be significantly reduced through this strategy.

AB  - X-ray tensor tomography (XTT) is a novel imaging modality for the three-dimensional reconstruction of X-ray scattering tensors from dark-field images obtained in a grating interferometry setup. The two-dimensional dark-field images measured in XTT are degraded by noise effects, such as detector readout noise and insufficient photon statistics, and consequently, the three-dimensional volumes reconstructed from this data exhibit noise artifacts. In this paper, we investigate the best way to incorporate a denoising technique into the XTT reconstruction pipeline, i.e., the popular total variation denoising technique. We propose two different schemes of including denoising in the reconstruction process, one using a column block-parallel iterative scheme and one using a whole-system approach. In addition, we compare the results when using a simple denoising approach applied either before or after reconstruction. The effectiveness is evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively based on datasets from an industrial sample and a clinical sample. The results clearly demonstrate the superiority of including denoising in the reconstruction process, along with slight advantages of the whole-system approach.

AB  - This paper presents a new method of reducing the noise in the EEG response signal recorded during repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). This noise is principally composed of the residual stimulus artefact and millivolt amplitude compound muscle action potentials (CMAP) recorded from the scalp muscles and precludes analysis of the cortical evoked potentials, especially during the first 20-ms post stimulus. The proposed method uses the wavelet transform with a fourth-order Daubechies mother wavelet and a novel coefficient reduction algorithm based on cortical amplitude thresholds. Four other mother wavelets as well as digital filtering have been tested, and the Coiflets 2 and 3 also found to be effective with Coiflet 3 results marginally better than Daubechies 4. The approach has been tested using data recorded from 16 normal subjects during a study of cortical sensitivity to rTMS at different cortical locations using stimulation amplitudes, frequencies, and sites typically used in clinical practice to treat major depressive disorder.

AB  - The fiber optic gyroscope (FOG) suffers from the excess relative intensity noise (RIN) caused by the broadband light source, which significantly impacts the angular random walk (ARW) of the FOG. The existing suppression methods for the excess RIN usually require complex configuration or devices with big volume, and thus are not suitable for practical applications especially in small-sized FOGs. What is more, as the key parameters or components, that determine the practical suppression effects of the excess RIN, and the corresponding impacting mechanisms are not clarified, there is no efficient way in evaluating or optimizing the excess-RIN reduction configuration in practice. In this work, we propose a simple but effective method to achieve the reduction of the excess RIN at the demodulation frequency, in which a Faraday rotator mirror is inserted to the dead arm of the source coupler to realize the delay line filter for the excess RIN. Experimental results show that the ARW is improved from 1.70 mdeg/h1/2 to 0.58 mdeg/h1/2 for a navigation-grade FOG. More importantly, this work provides a comprehensive understanding on how the main defects in the excess-RIN reduction scheme impact the practical excess-RIN suppression effects both theoretically and experimentally, which demonstrates the inherent robustness of the proposed scheme against internal and external influencing factors. This method is especially suitable for realizing the excess-RIN reduction in small-sized FOGs and upgrading the existing FOG products with minimal modifications, and is also potentially referable in evaluating and optimizing other similar excess-RIN reduction schemes.

AB  - Central processing unit (CPU) for any computer generally operates at constant power supply voltage. Normally in product specification, this power supply voltage has tolerance margin close to ±5%. It is shown in the previous works that for every millivolt drop in power supply voltage, the operation frequency of a chip reduces by about 2 MHz. This voltage drop occurs when CPU starts drawing current from the power supply. It is desirable to maintain the supply voltage within the specification of allowed voltage fluctuations so that the CPU can run at the target operating frequency, for a given package inductance and die decoupling capacitance. In this paper, power supply noise reduction method for multicore CPU in a given silicon chip has been considered. The concept of variable frequency has been applied on every core to minimize the noise by changing the current ramp of a multicore system. This reduces the dI/dt, and therefore for fixed package inductance and die decoupling capacitance, the power supply noise reduces. In this paper, four-core CPU has been taken and also shown the reduction of noise by changing the current ramp using variable clock frequency on each core and also by staggering the time when each core will start clocking.

AB  - The application of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) has become more and more widespread in recent years. However, the high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) problem is still one of the critical issues in the implementation of OFDM systems. Among the techniques of PAPR reduction, iterative clipping and filtering (ICF) is widely used due to its easy implement, and many ICF-based methods have been proposed recently. The optimized ICF (OICF) further has been designed with an optimized filter and achieves faster convergence rate. And the simplified OICF (SOICF) applies Lagrange multiplier method to simplify the problem solving as compared to OICF. The approach saves SOICF from using complicated convex optimization methods. Most recently the clipping-noise compression (CNC) method is proposed to reduce the required number of Fourier transforms by compressing the clipping noise in the time domain. Based on SOICF, this paper adopts clipping and noise compression to replace the calculation of PAPR-reduction vector in each iteration. Analysis shows that the computational complexity of the proposed scheme is lower than SOICF. In addition, we have improved the CNC technique and introduced a compression threshold in the proposed scheme. In each iteration, only the components whose amplitude exceeds the compression threshold are compressed, while the others remain unchanged. To this end, this reduces the amount of information lost, resulting in better BER performance. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme has better BER performance than SOICF, and better PAPR reduction than CNC. When equal amounts of PAPR reduction by the evaluated methods are actually achieved, the BER performance of the proposed scheme is better than SOICF and CNC, especially with high-order modulation or lower clipping ratio.

AB  - The increased switching frequency and speed of silicon carbide (SiC) MOSFETs lead to higher power density of inverters, but meanwhile resulting in weak electromagnetic interference (EMI). The impedance balance technique is a good way to reduce the common mode (CM) noise by making the voltage across the line impedance stabilization network (LISN) as small as possible. However, a side effect of this technique is the generation of relatively large loop current that circulates in the inverter. It can cause additional losses and cost, which can be a factor that stops the increase of the switching frequency by SiC MOSFET. This article, for the first time, analyzes the relationship between the CM noise and loop current of the three-level active neutral point clamped (ANPC) inverter, and proposes a co-reduction method for both. First, the CM noise and loop current are clarified for the ANPC inverter, and the analytical models for both are established. The conflict between the CM noise and loop current is introduced with a specific case by the existing design method. Then a co-reduction method is proposed and elaborated, which can both suppress the CM noise and the loop current. The extra cost and volume by the proposed method are also analyzed and are negligible. The design guideline is further shown for clarity. Finally, the analysis and proposed method is validated by the experiment.

AB  - This article proposes a new technique to reduce the readout noise in charge-coupled devices (CCDs). The objective is to minimize the common noise between the channels. This noise is either induced by the readout electronics or by the environment, and it could be present in small (single CCD and a few channels) or large systems (dozens of CCDs and hundreds of channels). By interleaving the video signals, we show that it is possible to reduce the readout noise by around 50% without sacrificing output channels at the expense of a moderate increase of the readout time, which is less compared with other techniques. Up until now, similar approaches have used half of the output stages only for noise measurement doubling the total readout time of the sensor. Simulations and experimental results are presented to validate the proposed approach. Moreover, the technique is measured using a Skipper CCD, and its operation is validated together with the ability of the Skipper sensor for nondestructively reading, several times, the same pixel charge. With the combination of both techniques, we achieve deep subelectron readout noise levels (0.1 e-).

AB  - The accuracy of geophysical parameter estimation made with interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) time-series techniques can be improved with rapidly increasing available data volumes and with the development of noise covariance matrices applicable to joint analysis of networks of interferograms. In this article, we present a new decorrelation phase covariance model and discuss its role in noise reduction in unwrapped interferometric phase stacks. We demonstrate with an example in which we average unwrapped interferogram phase stacks that span over a transient event how a noise covariance model can aid in noise reduction. Our model suggests that, for rapidly decorrelating surfaces (i.e., surfaces with much shorter correlation time than SAR acquisition intervals), it is preferable to incorporate all available interferograms from long observation windows. For slowly decorrelating surfaces (i.e., surfaces with longer correlation time than SAR acquisition intervals), our model suggests that a small subset of interferometric pairs is sufficient. We validate our model and three existing models of decorrelation phase covariance matrices in both Cascadia, a region with heavy vegetation cover, and Death Valley, a desert region with C-band Sentinel-1 A observations. Our proposed model matches observations with the smallest average discrepancy between theory and observations.

AB  - To reduce the iron loss and noise of a three-phase reactor composed of grain-oriented (GO) steel plates, two types of core structures are proposed in this article. In the first type, the ordinary brick core model is improved to a hybrid one composed of GO and nonoriented steel plates, and in the second type, the T-joint part of the ordinary oblique-joint core model is improved to a straight joint. To show the effectiveness of the improved models, the iron loss and displacement distributions in the four core structures are evaluated using the 2-D magnetic field and mechanical analyses. In these analyses, the magnetic characteristics of the anisotropic cores are considered in detail. Namely, in the magnetic field analysis, the B-H curves in the arbitrary directions are considered. In the iron loss calculation, the rotational iron loss is calculated using the iron loss curves in the arbitrary directions. Moreover, the methods of calculating the displacements due to electromagnetism and magnetostriction considering the anisotropic B-H curves and magnetostriction in the arbitrary directions are proposed. It is shown that the iron losses and displacements of the two proposed core structures can be reduced compared with the ordinary ones. Moreover, the second proposed model is the most attractive one because both the iron loss and displacement are smaller than the other models.

AB  - Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is a useful decomposition technique for multivariate data. More recently, NMF technology was used as a noise-estimation stage for a Wiener-filtering-based noise reduction (NR) method to improve the quality of noisy speech. Previous studies showed that this method provides better sound quality performance than conventional NMF-based approaches; however, there is still scope for improving the performance under noisy listening conditions. More specifically, the performance of an NMF noise estimator for calculating the noise level is considered sensitive to diverse noise environments and signal-to-noise ratio conditions. Therefore, we proposed an adaptive algorithm that derives an adaptive factor ($\alpha $ ) to adjust the weight between the estimated speech and noise levels on the basis of the signal-to-noise level for the gain function of the Wiener-filtering-based NR method to further improve the sound quality. Two objective evaluations and listening tests evaluated the benefits of the proposed method, and experimental results show that better output sound quality and competed for speech intelligibility performance can be achieved when compared with conventional unsupervised NR and NMF-based methods.

AB  - The design of variable span linear filters for noise reduction involves a generalized eigenvalue decomposition problem that is of high computational complexity. In order to address this issue, this work proposes a recursive algorithm that computes the filter weights with streaming signal data. Specifically, the inverse square root of the noise covariance matrix is recursively computed with a rank-one update strategy, and the generalized eigenvalues and eigenvectors are approached with the projection approximation subspace tracking method. Numerical simulations show that the proposed recursive method is able to achieve satisfactory performance with significantly lower complexity as compared to the batch algorithm.

AB  - The extra acoustic noise caused by the high-frequency (HF) signal injection imposes restrictions on its extensive applications for sensorless synchronous reluctance motor (SynRM) drives. To attenuate the undesired acoustic noise further, a hybrid pseudorandom (PR) signal injection scheme is proposed in this article. The hybrid PR signal injection is implemented by injecting square wave signals chosen in a random manner from a set of signals having either different frequencies or phases from each other. The optimal assembly of hybrid PR signals is designed via current power spectral density (PSD) analysis, aiming at reducing acoustic noise as much as possible. In this way, the proposed scheme achieves success in a massive acoustic noise reduction by means of completely eliminating the discrete harmonics of the current PSD and distributing the current PSD to a wider range. Besides, the low-pass filters used to separate the fundamental frequency component from injected HF components of currents could be eliminated because no discrete harmonics at injected frequencies exist with the proposed hybrid PR signal injection. The validity and superiority of the proposed sensorless control scheme are verified on a 3-kW position sensorless SynRM drive platform.

AB  - This paper presents a robust beamformer for stereo noise reduction in hearing aid applications. The worst-case optimization method was applied to the binaural minimum-variance distortionless-response (BMVDR) beamformer, for providing robustness against parameter estimation inaccuracies. This property is essential in real-world applications, since it is well known that steering-vector and noise-correlation estimation errors may significantly degrade the BMVDR performance. It is shown that its control parameters can be designed as a function of the noisy-speech interaural-level-difference estimate. Simulation experiments for synthetic and real-world noise, as well as for a range of signal to interference ratios (SIR) were performed. For a particular set of fixed control parameters, it is shown that the mean performance of the conventional BMVDR may be improved by 0.76 wideband perceptual evaluation of speech quality (WPESQ). The proposed method is especially effective for input SIRs higher than 10 dB, which is a crucial range for hearing aid users.

AB  - The accuracy of long-term position detection in dual-fiber optical trap is limited by low-frequency noise. We propose a technique that can reduce such noise. A position detection system for dual-fiber optical trap using a quadrant photodiode is built. The transmission light from the trapped particle is detected by two photodiodes. The normalized differential signal of transmission lights is demonstrated to carry the noise caused by asymmetric laser power fluctuation irradiating the microsphere, which is proved to dominate low-frequency noise. By subtracting this normalized difference from the position signal, the noise-reduction capability of this technique is remarkably 67% depending on detection bandwidth. It is expected to be applied to integrated and microfluidic fiber-optic trap system.

AB  - Benefiting from modeling human behavior and the multipath propagation of wireless signals in the environment, passive behavior-sensing systems can effectively identify individual behaviors by model-based or pattern-based methods. The existing methods use an individual sample to model or profile behavior feature, which leads to their failure in multiperson scenarios due to time-varying environments. In this paper, an online method on modeling the position-behavior feature of multiperson scene is presented. First, a position-based model of individual behavioral feature transformation is proposed. The behavior features in other positions are generated by the behavior of the individual in a particular position. Second, a multiperson behavior feature generation method based on noise reduction is proposed to generate the same behavior feature in an online pattern. Finally, taking advantage of the models, a multiperson fitness coaching system is designed and implemented, named multiuser fitness coach. The system can identify the irregular behavior of individuals in the multiperson environment. The performance of the system is evaluated in different scenarios, and the results show that the precision of feature generation can be effectively applied to the decision of irregular behavior in multiperson scenarios.

AB  - Acoustic signal contains information on the state of mechanical motion, but the disadvantage of low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is that acoustic signal without noise reduction is difficult to apply to fault diagnosis directly. This study proposes an adaptive noise reduction method based on the dislocation superposition method (DSM), which can realize automatic noise reduction for acoustic signals of low SNR synchronous hydraulic motors. First, the theoretical rotation period of the synchronous hydraulic motor is obtained according to the flow meter. Then, the actual signal is subjected to DSM processing according to the measurement accuracy of the flow meter and the theoretical rotation period to adjust the exact superposition length and the initial position of the actual signal. Finally, when the stop condition is not satisfied, the number of superposition is increased and the above process is repeated. The superimposed signal satisfying the stop condition is taken as the noise reduction signal. According to experimental results, the proposed method has good noise reduction effect on the acoustic signals of the synchronous hydraulic motor health state, wear out state of gear and end cover, and rust state of the gear. The noise reduction signal has been verified to have higher accuracy than the actual signal. Therefore, the proposed automatic noise reduction method can be applied to the noise reduction processing of other kinds of rotating mechanical acoustic signals.

AB  - Two novel phase noise filtering algorithms for interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) are presented in this paper. Aiming at the nonlocal high self-similarity existing in the InSAR phase, we establish the phase noise filtering formulations with the ℓ0-norm regularizer and the ℓ1-norm regularizer, respectively. Although these two original formulations are nonconvex, we attempt to solve them by successive upper bound minimization combined with dictionary learning method. Specifically, for the noise reduction formulation with the ℓ0-norm regularizer, we first divide the original problem into a series of decoupled subproblems. Second, we obtain the approximate subproblem, which is locally tight upper bound of each subproblem by using a majorization- minimization technique. Third, we compute the sparse parameter vector for each approximate subproblem, followed by a matrix form update for the dictionary. The three steps are tackled cyclically until a satisfying solution is attained. The noise reduction problem with the ℓ1-norm regularizer is handled in a similar approach. We also establish the computational complexities of these two methods and summarize their distinct performance. Simulation results based on both synthetic data and simulated InAR data show that these two new InSAR phase noise reduction methods have much better performance than several existing phase filtering methods.

AB  - In the actual integrated navigation process of the MEMS three-axis magnetometer, excessive measurement noise and external magnetic field interference often cause the magnetometer heading to be inaccurate, thereby reducing the overall performance of the integrated navigation system. In order to overcome the above influence, this paper proposes an adaptive real-time filtering noise reduction and comprehensive error interference compensation method. We have completed the construction of the measurement noise model and parameter update by analyzing the measurement noise characteristics of the MEMS three-axis magnetometer. We designed an adaptive filtering algorithm with multiple fading memory factors to perform offline noise reduction on the output data of the magnetometer, and use the noise-reduced data for comprehensive compensation of magnetic field interference, which has a good effect. The experimental results show that the proposed method has better filtering and noise reduction ability and higher compensation accuracy in offline state, can effectively reduce noise and compensate the magnetometer, and improve the accuracy of the magnetometer’s heading calculation.

AB  - In view of the problems of declined estimation and diagnostic accuracy, as well as diagnosis delay caused by the fixed model transformation probability of the interacting multiple model (IMM) fault diagnosis algorithm, an IMM algorithm based on low inertia noise reduction (LN-IMM) was presented in this paper. The proposed algorithm realized the multi-fault diagnosis of lithium-ion batteries in combination with strong tracking Kalman filter (STKF). In the non-model transformation stage, a transition probability correction function was constructed using the difference of the n-th order based on model probability to suppress the effect of noise on the estimation accuracy of the algorithm. In the model transformation stage, a model jump threshold was introduced in order to reduce inertia when the matched model was switched and realized quick model transformation. Accordingly, the final experiment proved that the LN-IMM-STKF algorithm efficiently completed the state estimation of lithium-ion batteries and improved the diagnostic accuracy of faults while reducing diagnosis delay and attaining accurate detection as well as rapid separation of battery fault information.

AB  - We developed a low-vibrational-noise cooling configuration using continuous liquefaction of evaporated helium gas from a multi-channel SQUID gradiometer system for whole-head magnetoencephalography (MEG) measurements. The initial reduction of the vibration of the cryocooler was done by rigidly mounting the remote motor and cold head chamber on a concrete wall. This significantly reduces transmission of vibrations to the transfer tube, especially compared with mounting them on vertical aluminum frames. In addition, to reduce vibrations from a mechanical SQUID array insert, we completely eliminated it by mounting each SQUID gradiometer separately on the helmet surface within the vacuum space. Thus, vibrations from the boiling liquid helium and transmission from the transfer tube were both greatly reduced. Magnetic field noise of the 150-channel SQUID gradiometer system showed that the vibration-induced interference peaks are comparable in amplitude to those from a conventional MEG system without helium reliquefaction.

The optical properties of the emitted pulse train, and the phase and amplitude noise of the RF pulse train generated after photodetection have been characterized with respect to the laser pumping rate, and to the injected power. We show that when injected, the laser exhibits a dramatic improvement of both RF phase noise and power spectrum, but at the expense of a degraded optical relative intensity noise.

AB  - We report on the spectral characteristics of the phase noise enhancement of continuous-wave (CW) optical signals passing through a semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA) operating in the saturation regime and used for relative intensity noise (RIN) reduction. We show that the known effect of phase noise enhancement, attributed to the linewidth enhancement factor of the device, happens only at a limited band of the phase noise spectrum, and the actual measurable linewidth of the output CW signal may not be affected. While this phase noise enhancement is not shown as an increase of spectral linewidth, it can still affect system performance when coherent detection is used, especially in applications with relatively low symbol rates. Numerical simulations and experimental results are used to support the observation. A single spectral line from a quantum-dot mode-locked laser is used as the light source, which is known to have relatively high RIN (> -120 dB/Hz in the low frequency region). Experimental transmission of 16-QAM modulation with coherent detection has been performed at 5 GBd to assess the implication on system performance.

AB  - To realize an ultralow-power, low-noise amplifier for bio-potential recording, we investigate three design techniques. The first technique uses a noise-efficient squeezed inverter (SQI) stage biased at the supply of the 2V  DSAT saturation limit. The challenge of interfacing the SQI stage with such a low supply is addressed by proposing a new capacitively-coupled chopper instrumentation amplifier (CCIA) with a low-noise DC servo loop (L-DSL) and an embedded ripple reduction loop (E-RRL). The second technique is reducing the high noise contribution of the conventional DSL. The proposed L-DSL reduces the input-referred noise (IRN) by removing the charge dividing effect. The proposed E-RRL inserted inside the gain stage cancels the offset and achieves a ripple suppression without loading the output. The CCIA is implemented using a 0.18 μm CMOS process. The measured results show that the L-DSL successfully creates a sub-Hz high-pass corner needed to block the electrode offset. The E-RRL achieves a ripple suppression of 39 dB. The CCIA achieves 32 nV/ √Hz noise density, which is slightly increased to 38 nV/ √Hz when the L-DSL is enabled. The integrated noise over 800 Hz bandwidth is 0.9 and 1.1 μV rms without and with the L-DSL, respectively. The mid-band gain of 39.6 dB is achieved by consuming 0.52 μW. These results correspond to a favorable noise efficiency factor (NEF) of 2.1 and a power efficiency factor (PEF) of 1.2.

AB  - In this paper, a subspace speech enhancement method handling the case of colored noise using oblique projection in the cepstral domain is proposed. Perceptual features and variance normalization are used to reduce the residual noise and improve the intelligibility of the output speech. Initially, the additive noise present in the noisy speech is removed by removing the orthogonal noise subspace from the noisy speech subspace to obtain the speech subspace. Then, the oblique projection of the noise subspace on the speech subspace along the additive noise subspace is used to determine the colored noise that remains. Colored noise removal is performed by power spectral subtraction in the cepstral domain. The spectral domain constrained estimator that incorporates the combined masking property of the human auditory system is employed to estimate the clean speech signal using the variance of the colored noise. To avoid the occurrence of any abrupt spikes in the output, variance normalization is performed by adaptively changing the control parameter of the estimator's gain matrix. The spectrograms, the objective measures and the subjective intelligibility test show the superior performance of the proposed method over the other existing speech enhancement methods.

AB  - The echo signal of light detection and ranging (LiDAR) system is easily disturbed by various noises under the influence of intense background light. The signal to noise ratio (SNR) decreases with increasing distance, which seriously affects the retrieval accuracy of the LiDAR system. This paper combines local mean decomposition and an improved thresholding method (LMD-ITM) to process the Lidar signal with a lot of noise, so as to avoid the loss of useful information. In this research, the correlation coefficient and energy entropy are used to distinguish between the relevant and irrelevant components decomposed by the local mean decomposition. Subsequently, the improved thresholding method is applied to process the irrelevant components. It can extract the effective signals which are difficult to be separated from the high-frequency signals. Finally, all components are reconstructed to get the denoising signal. The experimental results demonstrate that this method can effectively avoid the short-range migration, suppress the long-range noise, and adapt to different weather conditions. Compared with the previous denoising method, the proposed method increases the SNR by about 15%.

AB  - High-fidelity photodetection enables the transfer of the low noise inherent to optical oscillators to the microwave domain. However, when photodetecting optical signals of the highest timing stability, photodiode flicker (1/f) noise can dominate the resulting timing jitter at timescales longer than ~1 ms. With the goal of improving femtosecond-level timing fidelity when transferring from the optical to microwave domain, we vary the duty cycle of a train of optical pulses and show that the photodetector flicker phase noise on a photonically generated 1 GHz microwave signal can be reduced by ~10 dB under ultrashort pulse illumination, reaching as low as -140/f dBc/Hz. In addition, a strong correlation between amplitude and phase flicker noise is found, implying a single baseband noise source can modulate both quadratures of the microwave carrier. These findings expand the limits of the ultimate timing stability that can be transferred from optics to electronics.

AB  - With the emergence of new sensing technologies, soft substrate-based displacement sensing has gained popularity in the last decade. Nevertheless, performance degradation due to noise from unexpected vibrations of the substrate can affect the sensor's accuracy and lead to poor measurements. Few studies have focused on noise reduction to improve the accuracy of the sensing data. Based on mathematical modeling, this paper compares the two most representative filtering algorithms based on minimum mean square error (MMSE), namely recursive least squares (RLS) and Kalman algorithms for their predictive ability, accuracy, and reliability. Based on the modeling and comparison, we propose a Kalman filtering algorithm to suppress the vibration noise in the displacement-based dosage sensor. The filter-processed data from the sensor's measurement mainly contains the actual resistance change upon mechanical displacement of the sensor substrate and the undesired noise from its vibration. With the filtering algorithm, the noise can be reduced from the sensor's measurement, and an accurate correlation between resistance change and displacement of the sensor can be established. This would provide a straightforward sensing signal that reflects the displacement, and in turn, achieves precise dosage monitoring in drug delivery devices, which can be used as a test-bed application for the sensor.

AB  - In this article, balance technique is applied into two-channel interleaved three-phase ac–dc converters with critical conduction mode based soft switching modulation. By adding additional inductors and coupling them with the original ones, the realization of the balance becomes possible with proper design; thus reducing the common-mode (CM) EMI noise. The balance condition is derived, and the impact of balance technique on the circuit operation especially on the switching frequency variation is quantified in order to provide the design guideline. Based on the application of balance technique, instead of the commonly used litz-wire-based inductors, PCB winding coupled inductors are adopted and designed to effectively achieve the reduction of CM EMI noise. The design methodology and process are presented, and the design tradeoff is made between the inductor loss and the inductor footprint. Finally, the effect of CM EMI noise reduction and the system efficiency with balance techniques and PCB winding magnetics are tested on a 25-kW silicon-carbide-based soft-switching three-phase ac–dc converter prototype.

AB  - Resistive Random Access Memory (ReRAM) is a promising novel memory technology for non-volatile storing, with low-power operation and ultra-high area density. However, ReRAM memories still face issues through commercialization, mainly owing to the fact that the high fabrication variations and the stochastic switching of the manufactured ReRAM devices cause high Bit Error Rate (BER). Given that ReRAM devices are nonlinear elements, the nonlinear phenomenon of Stochastic Resonance (SR), which defines that an input disturbance with specific characteristics can improve the total performance of the nonlinear system, is used to reduce the ReRAM cell's BER. Thus, in this brief, the BER of a single ReRAM cell is explored, using the Stanford PKU model, and is improved after the application of specific additive input noise. The power dissipation of the proposed approach is also evaluated and compared with the consideration of higher amplitude writing pulses in the lack of noise, showing that the proposed noise-induced technique can decrease the BER without the excessive increase of the power dissipation. As a first step, towards the experimental verification of the proposed method, noise-induced measurements on a single fabricated ReRAM device are also performed. Overall, the presented results of the BER reduction with low power dissipation, reaching up to 3.26× less power consumption considering 100 ns writing pulses, are encouraging for ReRAM designers, delivering a circuit-level solution against the device-level problem.

AB  - In MOS transistors, low-frequency noise phenomena such as random telegraph signal (RTS), burst, and flicker or 1/f noise are usually attributed to the random nature of the trap state of defects present at the gate Si-SiO2 interface. In a previous work, theoretical modeling and analysis of the RTS and 1/f noise in MOS transistor was presented and it was shown that this 1/f noise power can be reduced by decreasing the duty cycle (D) of switched biasing signal. In this paper, an extended analysis of this 1/f noise reduction model is presented and it is shown that the RTS noise reduction is accompanied with shift in the corner frequency (fc) of the 1/f noise and the value of shift is a function of continuous ON time (Ton) of the device. This 1/f noise reduction is also experimentally demonstrated in this paper using a circuit configuration with multiple identical transistor stages which produce a continuous output instead of a discrete signal. The circuit is implemented in 180 nm standard CMOS technology, from UMC. According to the measurement results, the proposed technique reduces the 1/f noise power by approximately 5.9 dB at switching frequency (fs) of 1 KHz for 2 stage, which is extended up to 16 dB at fs of 5 MHz for six stage configuration.

AB  - Radiation exposure in CT imaging leads to increased patient risk. This motivates the pursuit of reduced-dose scanning protocols, in which noise reduction processing is indispensable to warrant clinically acceptable image quality. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have received significant attention as an alternative for conventional noise reduction and are able to achieve state-of-the art results. However, the internal signal processing in such networks is often unknown, leading to sub-optimal network architectures. The need for better signal preservation and more transparency motivates the use of Wavelet Shrinkage Networks (WSNs), in which the Encoding-Decoding (ED) path is the fixed wavelet frame known as Overcomplete Haar Wavelet Transform (OHWT) and the noise reduction stage is data-driven. In this work, we considerably extend the WSN framework by focusing on three main improvements. First, we simplify the computation of the OHWT that can be easily reproduced. Second, we update the architecture of the shrinkage stage by further incorporating knowledge of conventional wavelet shrinkage methods. Finally, we extensively test its performance and generalization, by comparing it with the RED and FBPConvNet CNNs. Our results show that the proposed architecture achieves similar performance to the reference in terms of MSSIM (0.667, 0.662 and 0.657 for DHSN2, FBPConvNet and RED, respectively) and achieves excellent quality when visualizing patches of clinically important structures. Furthermore, we demonstrate the enhanced generalization and further advantages of the signal flow, by showing two additional potential applications, in which the new DHSN2 is used as regularizer: (1) iterative reconstruction and (2) ground-truth free training of the proposed noise reduction architecture. The presented results prove that the tight integration of signal processing and deep learning leads to simpler models with improved generalization.

AB  - Low-field NMR technology has been widely used in many fields, among which the most representative method is the use of CPMG sequence for T2 measurement. Important parameters such as permeability, saturation and fluid type of porous media can be obtained by T2 spectrum inversion calculation of NMR echo sequence signal. However, T2 spectrum inversion calculation is easily affected by noise signals. Improving the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of echo signal is one of the key problems with the application of low-field NMR technology. Therefore, in order to obtain more accurate analysis results, it is necessary to develop corresponding noise reduction methods. The past researches on NMR signal noise reduction mainly focus on echo string. In this paper, a complete NMR signal model is constructed, and the problem of the echo and echo string de-noising is discussed. FIR filter and orthogonal modulation filter (OMF) are studied for noise reduction of echo. To solve the problem of echo string de-noising, an improved complementary ensemble empirical mode decomposition (CEEMD) threshold de-noising method is proposed and compared with the heuristic threshold de-noising method based on sym4 wavelet and the previous empirical mode decomposition (EMD) threshold de-noising method. Based on the construction model and practical verification, it is proved that the proposed method can invert the more accurate T2 spectrum while improving the signal-to-noise ratio. The research results of this paper provide a strong support for the application of low-field NMR technology in the environment of strong noise.

AB  - Detection using continuous wave (CW) is inherently prone to undesired fluctuations in the phase of the transmitted (Tx) wave and hence is highly vulnerable to phase noise (PN). Along with hardware-based solutions, there are several software-based techniques to alleviate the PN in frequency-modulated CW (FMCW) detection systems. These methods generally employ a parallel transmit/receive channel, using a delay-line, to instantaneously extract the PN of the Tx wave and next, they propose a PN removal method to eliminate its impacts on the received FMCW beat signal. In this article, we introduce a general noise removal approach based on determination and resolution of the PN inverse problem. Thereafter, we propose a method to adapt this approach to the FMCW PN problem. Subsequently, a systematic comparison between the existing methods and the introduced one is made. It is pointed out that the inverse method does not rely on short-range (SR) approximations and therefore, its applicability is extendable to medium-range (MR) and long-range (LR) radars. At the end, the capability of the proposed approach compared with the existing ones-which are mainly based on SR approximations-is assessed in a field experiment.

AB  - We try to improve the limit of the phase estimation of the interference fringe at low electron dose levels in electron holography by a noise reduction method. In this paper, we focus on unsupervised approaches to apply it to electron beam-sensitive and unknown samples and describe an overview of denoising methods used widely in image processing, such as wiener filter, total variation denoising, nonlocal mean filters and wavelet thresholding. We compare the wavelet hidden Markov model (WHMM) denoising that we have studied so far with the other conventional noise reduction methods. We evaluate the denoise performance of each method using the peak signal-to-noise ratio between noise-free and the target holograms (noisy or denoised holograms) and the root mean-square error (RMSE) between the true phase of the fringe and the measured phase by the discrete Fourier transform phase estimator. We show the denoised holograms for simulation and experimental data by using each noise reduction method and then discuss evaluation indexes obtained from these denoised holograms. From experimental results, it can be seen that the WHMM denoising can reduce the RMSE of fringe phase to about 1/4.5 for noisy simulation holograms and it has stable and good performance for noise reduction of observed holograms with various image qualities.

AB  - Noise reduction is important for X-ray images because it can reduce radiation exposure to patients. X-ray image noise has a Poisson-Gaussian distribution, and recently, noise analysis and removal in multiscale transformations have been widely implemented. The nonsubsampled contourlet transform (NSCT) is a multiscale transformation suitable for medical images that separates the scale and direction. This study proposes a Poisson-Gaussian noise-removal method using NSCT shrinkage that is based on the characteristics of Poisson-Gaussian noise in NSCT domain. It has the structure of a block-matching 3D filtering algorithm in the form of basic estimation and noise removal process; however, the main processes are modified to consider Poisson-Gaussian noise characteristics. In the basic estimation process, an NSCT shrinkage method that is suitable for Poisson-Gaussian noise characteristics is developed by optimizing the local linear minimum mean square error estimator in the NSCT domain. In the denoising step, the noise term of the Wiener filter is determined using the result of the NSCT shrinkage, and finally, the denoised image is obtained. The proposed method is applied to simulated and real X-ray images and is compared with other state-of-the-art Poisson-Gaussian noise removal methods; it exhibits excellent results in both quantitative and qualitative aspects.

AB  - This paper presents a new low-voltage CMOS structure for operational transconductance amplifier (OTA) exploiting the bulk-driven, the self-cascode and the multiple-input transistor techniques (MI). The multiple-input OTA (MIOTA) circuit operates in subthreshold region using 0.5V supply voltage and offers enhanced linearity. The MIOTA is developed for biopotential signal as well as electrocardiogram (ECG) signal processing circuit and it is exploited to design a 5th-order Chebyshev low-pass and 3rd-order band-pass filters with a dynamic range (DR) of 57.6 dB and 60.4 dB, and nanopower consumption of 50 nW and 60 nW, respectively. Due to the electronic tuning of cut-off frequency, the low-pass and band-pass filters are suitable for random noise and motion artifact noise reductions in biopotential signals. The circuits were designed in Cadence environment using the standard N-well <inline-formula> <tex-math notation="LaTeX">$0.18~\mu \text{m}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> TSMC CMOS technology. Intensive post-layout simulation results along with the process, voltage, temperature analysis (PVT) and Monte Carlo (MC) prove the robustness of the design. The chip area of the proposed MIOTA is 0.00725 mm<sup>2</sup> (<inline-formula> <tex-math notation="LaTeX">$118~\mu \text{m}\,\,\times 61.5\,\,\mu \text{m}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>). Compared with standard OTA the MIOTA offers simplification of filter topology and reduced number of active elements. In order to demonstrate these advantages, the MIOTA-based filter was also build using commercially available OTA LT1228. The experimental results of OTA LT1228 confirm both the filter functionality and the advantages of the proposed MIOTA.

AB  - This article proposes and investigates a control technique for vibration and acoustic noise reduction in Switched Reluctance Machines (SRMs). A large vibration generally occurs at the turn-off stage of SRM phase voltage due to a sudden decrease in the attraction force. The proposed technique is a smooth voltage Pulse-Width Modulation (PWM) method that utilizes the PWM technique to reduce the rate of change of voltage during the turn-off commutation angle. The aim of this proposed method is to control the vibration with high PWM frequency at the very beginning stage when the vibration is low before being developed into higher amplitude at the turn-off stage, without having to generate anti-phase vibration. Both simulation and experimental testing are implemented to confirm the capabilities and limitations of this technique.

AB  - Outdoor recording is particularly challenging in the presence of wind, which induces highly non-stationary noise in the microphone signals. To enhance a desired signal, e.g., speech, a dedicated noise reduction processing is required. The reduction is usually performed by estimating an unknown set of parameters, e.g., the noise and the speech power spectral densities (PSDs). In contrast to the commonly used assumption of uncorrelated wind noise in multi-channel recordings, we assume the spatial correlation of wind noise contributions to be non-zero at low frequencies when closely-spaced microphones are employed. In our earlier work, we assumed that the spatial coherence was known, i.e., given by a model which depends on the free-field speed and direction of the air stream. As these quantities are unknown in practice, we propose in this work a method to recursively estimate the spatial coherence matrix based on the microphone observations. In addition, we prove the equivalence of two recently developed noise PSD estimation methods when uncorrelated wind noise is assumed, and we propose an approximation of both estimators which is independent of the propagation vector of the speech source at sufficiently low frequency and for a small inter-microphone distance. An evaluation in terms of improvements in speech quality, signal-to-noise ratio and intelligibility is carried out using both simulated and measured wind noise samples.

AB  - Infrared focal plane arrays imaging system tend to be affected by the interior thermal radiation that drifts slowly over the time, resulting in the continuous spatial low-frequency nonuniformity noise in the image. In this paper, a scene-based nonuniformity correction method for interior thermal radiation is proposed. The gradient domain least mean square (LMS) algorithm is used to estimate the gradient caused by the interior radiation noise according to the fixed spatial low-frequency information in multiframe images. After that, the calibration parameters are obtained by fitting the derivatives of the polynomial-based correction model with the calculated gradient image. The performance of the proposed method is thoroughly studied with infrared image sequences with simulated nonuniformity and real nonuniformity. The results show that the proposed algorithm can remove interior radiation noise more completely without ghosting artifacts than the state-of-art algorithms and is more robust to different scenarios.

AB  - This article presents a wide-band suppression technique of flicker phase noise (PN) by means of a gate–drain phase shift in a transformer-based complementary oscillator. We identify that after naturally canceling its second-harmonic voltage by the complementary operation itself, third-harmonic current entering the capacitive path is now the main cause of asymmetry in the rising and falling edges, leading to the  $1/f$  noise upconversion. A complete  $1/f^{3}$  PN analysis for the transformer-based complementary oscillator is discussed. By tuning gate–drain capacitance ratio, a specific phase-shift range is introduced at the gate and drain nodes of the cross-coupled pair to mitigate the detrimental effects of ill-behaved third-harmonic voltage, thus lowering the flicker PN. To further reduce the area and improve the PN in the thermal region, we introduce a new triple-8-shaped transformer. Fabricated in 22-nm FDSOI, the prototype occupies a compact area of 0.01mm2 and achieves  $1/f^{3}$  PN corner of 70kHz, PN of −110dBc/Hz at 1MHz offset, figure-of-merit (FoM) of −182dB at 9GHz, and 39% tuning range (TR). It results in the best FoM with normalized TR and area (FoMTA) of −214dB at 1MHz offset.

AB  - In this study, a voice activity detection technique is designed using features such as short-term energy, periodicity and spectral flatness. The desired results are obtained by using these three features, even at low signal to noise ratio values. In addition, performance of multi-channel noise reduction algorithms such as Wiener speech distortion weighted, spatial prediction, minimum variance distortion-less response are compared using the proposed voice activity detection. Two different audio signals and three different noise types are used in the experiment. Noisy speech and only detection of noisy areas have been performed by proposed voice activity detection algorithm. The filter coefficients have been calculated for each filter algorithm used after detection of noisy speech and only noisy areas. The calculated filter coefficients have been multiplied by the frequency components of the signal received from the reference microphone to obtain an enhanced signal. Segmental signal to noise ratio, an objective method, and mean opinion score as a subjective method have been used to evaluate the performance of the filters. Speech distortion weighted Wiener filter has been found to be the best filter for noise reduction performance.

AB  - Astronomical images obtained from existing cameras are subjected to various types of noise artifacts. Impulse noise is one of them and it is visible as dark and bright spots on the image. Common practice to remove impulse noise is to perform averaging of several frames. This will increase signal-to-noise ratio of the image, however, impulse noise might still be present. The noisy image will hinder the performance of further processing operations such as edge detection. In this brief, variable pixel G-neighbor temporal filtering circuit is proposed to improve the quality of astronomical images with the impulse noise. As compared to conventional averaging of frames in the time domain, where all pixels are summed, the proposed circuit select pixels in each frame that are closest to the reference pixel. The circuit operates in the analog domain, and it was designed and tested using 180-nm CMOS technology. Simulations demonstrate improvement in the peak-signal-to-noise (PSNR) ratio, mean-squared-error (MSE) and structural similarity index measure (SSIM) as compared to conventional averaging of frames.

AB  - In this letter, an in-pixel chopping technique to reduce the low-frequency or 1/f noise of the source follower (SF) transistor in an active pixel sensor (APS) is presented. The SF low-frequency noise is modulated at higher frequencies through chopping, implemented inside the pixel, and in later stage eliminated using low-pass filtering. To implement the chopping, the conventional 3T APS architecture is modified, with only one additional transistor of minimum size per pixel. Reduction in the noise also enhances the dynamic range of the image sensor. The prototype sensor, consists of a 128 × 128 sized pixel array with in-pixel chopping and column-level read-out circuit, is fabricated in AMS 0.35-μm CMOS OPTO process. The pixel is laid out at the pitch of 10.5 μm with a fillfactor of 30%. To validate the proposed technique a 2 × 2 pixel array is characterized. The output noise integrated in the frequency band from 1 Hz to 20 kHz is measured as 210 μVRMS and 191 μVRMS at chopping frequency (fch) of 4 MHz and 8 MHz, respectively, which shows a reduction in the noise power by 13.3 and 14.2 dB, respectively.

AB  - This paper presents a 14-b 20-MS/s energy-efficient SAR ADC in 65-nm CMOS technology for portable medical ultrasound systems. To break the limitation of the ADC linearity on the DAC size in a SAR ADC, a background mismatch calibration technique is employed. As a result, the thermal noise will be the major constraint for the DAC size. In addition, a compact noise-reduction technique is proposed to alleviate the adverse impact of the input-referred comparator noise on the effective resolution. Moreover, a 2.5-V on-chip LDO, which serves as the reference generator for the ADC core, is also integrated to guarantee the reference accuracy and to suppress the supply noise. To reduce the capacitive load of the comparator and boost the comparison speed, a low fan-in SAR logic is also designed. With the proposed mismatch calibration technique and the noise-reduction technique activated, measured results indicate that the peak signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio (SNDR) and the spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR) achieve 78.8 dB and 95.4 dB, respectively. At 20 MS/s, the ADC consumes 6.8mW from its 1.2 V/3.3V supplies in total, leading to an SNDR-based Schreier FOM of 170.5 dB at Nyquist. The active area of the ADC is 450 × 540μm2.

AB  - An ultra-high precision magnetic field measurement is of great scientific and economic significance. An atomic magnetometer that operates in a spin-exchange relaxation-free (SERF) regime has superior sensitivity and, thus, is of great significance for the ultra-high precision magnetic field measurement. In order to reduce the noise of a SERF atomic magnetometer and further improve its sensitivity, a method for noise reduction based on the multigene genetic programming (MGGP) is presented. Different from the existing methods, in this method, the model of magnetometer noise is established based on the experimental data. Namely, the noise of the SERF atomic magnetometer is first modeled by the MGGP algorithm and then reduced by the obtained model. Besides, in this way, the sensitivity is improved. The experimental results indicate that our MGGP model can adequately reflect the characteristics of the SERF magnetometer noise. Moreover, after applying the proposed method, the sensitivity of the SERF magnetometer is improved about 13 times at 1 Hz, and there is also a significant sensitivity increase at the frequencies less than 10 Hz. Therefore, the proposed method can effectively reduce the noise and improve the sensitivity of the SERF magnetometer in the low-frequency band.

AB  - The shielding of electromagnetic noise is critical in obtaining magnetic resonance imaging measurements in the ultra-low magnetic field regime where the intrinsic signal-to-noise ratio is very small. The traditional approach of using an enclosure for electromagnetic shielding is expensive and hinders system portability. We describe here the use of a CNN-based software gradiometer to suppress the effect of electromagnetic ambient background noise sources that inductively couple into the signal detection coils. The system involves three ambient noise monitoring coils placed at a distance from the magnetic resonance signal detector. The three coils were used to synthesize the ambient noise captured by the signal detector; a convolutional neural network approach was used. Mathematical foundations are provided to justify the noise suppression framework. The results show that as much as 20-fold noise suppression can be achieved using an optimized convolutional neural network and simultaneous ambient noise measurements. The proposed approach has the potential to replace the requirement for magnetically shielded enclosures and make ultra-low field magnetic resonance imaging truly portable.

AB  - Raw optical coherence tomography (OCT) images typically are of low quality because speckle noise blurs retinal structures, severely compromising visual quality and degrading performances of subsequent image analysis tasks. In our previous study (Ma et al., 2018), we have developed a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) for speckle noise removal in OCT images collected by several commercial OCT scanners, which we collectively refer to as scanner T. In this paper, we improve the cGAN model and apply it to our in-house OCT scanner (scanner B) for speckle noise suppression. The proposed model consists of two steps: 1) We train a Cycle-Consistent GAN (CycleGAN) to learn style transfer between two OCT image datasets collected by different scanners. The purpose of the CycleGAN is to leverage the ground truth dataset created in our previous study. 2) We train a mini-cGAN model based on the PatchGAN mechanism with the ground truth dataset to suppress speckle noise in OCT images. After training, we first apply the CycleGAN model to convert raw images collected by scanner B to match the style of the images from scanner T, and subsequently use the mini-cGAN model to suppress speckle noise in the style transferred images. We evaluate the proposed method on a dataset collected by scanner B. Experimental results show that the improved model outperforms our previous method and other state-of-the-art models in speckle noise removal, retinal structure preservation and contrast enhancement.

AB  - Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) is a method to measure cardiac activities without any contact sensors. Non-contact sensors include radar, laser, and digital cameras, and there have been wide developments regarding the measurement of rPPG signals using continuous face frames. However, non-contact sensors are quite sensitive to the subject's motion, which causes motion artifacts. In this paper, two hypotheses are proposed: a) the motion artifacts are caused by unevenly reflected light due to the curvature of the subject's face; and b) melanin and residuals in the continuous face frames are time-varying values whenever the subject's movement is triggered. Adaptive noise cancellation based on recursive least square (ANS based on RLS) using the Lambert-Beer law and the hue-saturation-intensity (HSI) model were applied. The former is used for skin modeling, and the latter is used to reduce noises derived by the curvature of the face. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm is directly applied to two-dimensional continuous face frames and results in the rPPG signal and rPPG image, respectively. To evaluate proposed algorithm, two different experiments (e.g., static and dynamic situation) were conducted. Furthermore, in a study with 15 participants, the performances of heart rate estimation and heart rate variability (HRV) were evaluated by comparing the proposed method with previously developed methods. The results showed that a) the artifacts derived by head movement are efficiently removed, compared to previous methods; and b) rPPG images describing the spread of facial blood flow are acquired in real-time.

AB  - Low-frequency mymargin noise, thermal noise, and dc characteristics of nanoscale MOS transistors with dimensions close to the process minimum are highly variable. This article demonstrates a phase noise (PN) reduction technique for LC voltage-controlled oscillators (VCOs) that use an intelligent post-fabrication selection of a subset of an array of near minimum-size cross-coupled transistor pairs with reduced low-frequency noise and thermal noise. Using the technique, the PN of a VCO is lowered from the maximum by 3.5 dB at 600-kHz, 1-MHz, and 3-MHz offsets from a 3.8-GHz carrier. The lowest PN of −122, −129, and −139.5 dBc/Hz at 600-kHz, 1-MHz, and 3-MHz offsets, respectively, from a 3.8-GHz carrier has been measured using the PLL method of the Keysight E5052B Signal Source Analyzer. The VCO prototype was fabricated in a 65-nm CMOS process and dissipates 7 mW of dc power. The maximum figure of merit (FoM), including PN, carrier frequency, and power consumption, is 193 dBc/Hz, and the FoM, including the VCO core area,  ${\mathrm {FoM}}_{A}$ , is 209 dBc/Hz.

AB  - Noise reduction is one of the most important process used for signal processing in communication systems. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is a key parameter to consider for minimizing the bit error rate (BER). The inherent noise found in millimeter-wave systems is mainly a combination of white noise and phase noise. Increasing the SNR in wireless data transfer systems can lead to reliability and performance improvements. To address this issue, we propose to use a recurrent neural network (RNN) with a long short-term memory (LSTM) autoencoder architecture to achieve signal noise reduction. This design is based on a composite LSTM autoencoder with a single encoder layer and two decoder layers. A V-band receiver test bench is designed and fabricated to provide a high-speed wireless communication system. Constellation diagrams display the output signals measured for various random sequences of PSK and QAM modulated signals. The LSTM autoencoder is trained in real time using various noisy signals. The trained system is then used to reduce noise levels in the tested signals. The SNR of the designed receiver is of the order of 11.8dB, and it increases to 13.66dB using the three-level LSTM autoencoder. Consequently, the proposed algorithm reduces the bit error rate from 10−8 to 10−11. The performance of the proposed algorithm is comparable to other noise reduction strategies. Augmented denoised signals are fed into a ResNet-152 deep convolutional network to perform the final classification. The demodulation types are classified with an accuracy of 99.93%. This is confirmed by experimental measurements.

AB  - This letter proposes a trilateral filtering algorithm for speckle reduction in video synthetic aperture radar (video SAR). The novel filter takes traditional bilateral filter as the basic framework, so as to fully exploit the similarities of gray levels and the spatial location of neighboring pixels. Moreover, the proposed trilateral filter additionally exploits the temporal correlation information among adjacent image frames of the SAR videos and effectively reduces the interference of redundant information by using an adaptive similar frame selection technology. Comprehensively considering the three-dimensional (3-D) correlation information of spatial, temporal, and gray scale, a triple-similarity kernel is specifically developed for video SAR despeckling. The proposed trilateral filter can effectively smooth the speckle noise while greatly sustain the details of each image frame of the SAR videos. Experiments show that the proposed algorithm has better despeckling performance compared with other algorithms.

AB  - The paper presents distributed algorithms for combined acoustic echo cancellation (AEC) and noise reduction (NR) in a wireless acoustic sensor and actuator network (WASAN) where each node may have multiple microphones and multiple loudspeakers, and where the desired signal is a speech signal. A centralized integrated AEC and NR algorithm, i.e., multichannel Wiener filter (MWF), is used as starting point where echo signals are viewed as background noise signals and loudspeaker signals are used as additional input signals to the algorithm. By including prior knowledge (PK), namely that the loudspeaker signals do not contain any desired signal component, an alternative centralized cascade algorithm (PK-MWF) is obtained with an AEC stage first followed by an MWF-based NR stage which has a lower computational complexity. Distributed algorithms can then be obtained from the MWF and PK-MWF algorithm, i.e., the generalized eigenvalue decomposition (GEVD)-based distributed adaptive node-specific signal estimation (DANSE) and PK-GEVD-DANSE algorithm, respectively. In the former, each node performs a reduced dimensional integrated AEC and NR algorithm and broadcasts only 1 fused signal (instead of all its signals) to the other nodes. In the PK-GEVD-DANSE algorithm, each node performs a reduced dimensional cascade AEC and NR algorithm and broadcasts only 2 fused signals (instead of all its signals) to the other nodes. The distributed algorithms achieve the same performance, upon convergence, as the corresponding centralized integrated (MWF) and centralized cascade (PK-MWF) algorithm. It is observed, however, that the communication cost in the PK-GEVD-DANSE algorithm can also be reduced, where each node then broadcasts only 1 fused signal (instead of 2 signals) to the other nodes. The resulting algorithm, referred to as the pruned PK-GEVD-DANSE (pPK-GEVD-DANSE) algorithm, then effectively combines the lowest possible communication cost (as low as in the GEVD-DANSE algorithm) with a lowest possible computational complexity in each node (further reduced from the PK-GEVD-DANSE computational complexity), within the class of algorithms considered in this paper.

AB  - There is a constant need for Hall-effect magnetic sensors with lower noise and lower offset for the high accuracy analog applications driven primarily by industrial and automotive markets, for example, high dynamic range current sensing for battery management in electric vehicles. Graphene-based Hall sensors (GHSs) demonstrate low thermal noise due to their high carrier mobility but suffer from large low-frequency flicker noise and offset limiting the prevalent low-frequency applications. In this paper, we present the results of a recently proposed gate modulation scheme for GHSs that uses dynamic ambipolar operation to up-convert the input magnetic signal to higher modulating frequencies while the offset and flicker noise remain spectrally unchanged and thus enabling thermal noise limited performance. We implement a prototype GHS using a scalable fabrication process with CVD graphene transferred on to silicon-oxide and followed by standard thin film and subsequent photolithographic processes. The measurement results confirm the effectiveness of dynamic ambipolar gate modulation technique in producing low offset of  $- 524\,\,\mu \mathrm{T}$  in conjunction with three orders of magnitude estimated improvement in the low frequency noise performance.

AB  - Bowel sounds (BSs) have important clinical value in the auxiliary diagnosis of digestive diseases, but due to the inconvenience of long-term monitoring and too much interference from environmental noise, they have not been well studied. Most of the current electronic stethoscopes are hard and bulky without the function of noise reduction, and their application for long-term wearable monitoring of BS in noisy clinical environments is very limited. In this paper, a flexible dual-channel digital auscultation patch with active noise reduction is designed and developed, which is wireless, wearable, and conformably attached to abdominal skin to record BS more accurately. The ambient noise can be greatly reduced through active noise reduction based on the adaptive filter. At the same time, some nonstationary noises appearing intermittently (e.g., frictional noise) can also be removed from BS by the cross validation of multichannel simultaneous acquisition. Then, two kinds of typical BS signals are taken as examples, and the feature parameters of the BS in the time domain and frequency domain are extracted through the time-frequency analysis algorithm. Furthermore, based on the short-term energy ratio between the four channels of dual patches, the two-dimensional localization of BS on the abdomen mapping plane is realized. Finally, the continuous wearable monitoring of BS for patients with postoperative ileus (POI) in the noisy ward from pre-operation (POD0) to postoperative Day 7 (POD7) was carried out. The obtained change curve of the occurrence frequency of BS provides guidance for doctors to choose a reasonable feeding time for patients after surgery and accelerate their recovery. Therefore, flexible dual-channel digital auscultation patches with active noise reduction will have promising applications in the clinical auxiliary diagnosis of digestive diseases.

AB  - High-stability optical frequency comparison over fiber link enables the establishment of ultrastable optical clock networks, having the potential to promote a series of applications, including metrology, geodesy, and astronomy. In this article, we theoretically analyze and experimentally demonstrate a time-delayed local two-way (TD-LTW) optical frequency comparison scheme with improved comparison stability, showing that the fractional instability of optical frequency comparison over a 50-km transfer link can be reduced from $1.30\times 10^{-15}$ to $5.25\times 10^{-16}$ at the 1 s integration time with an improvement factor of 2.48. Additionally, we also for the first time model and experimentally verify the effect of the inhomogeneous phase noise along the fiber link on the system performance. We believe that the theory and technique proposed here will be helpful in developing the high-stability optical clock networks over large-area fiber links.

AB  - In this paper, the necessity of segmented image denoising in the signal post-processing of Brillouin Optical Time Domain sensors (BOTDS) is investigated firstly, then a novel cross-correlation based Brillouin-spectrum-partition (BSP) method is proposed to denoise the noisy Brillouin gain or loss spectrum in BOTDS. In the BSP filter, the non-correlation factors of adjacent Brillouin scattering spectrum are firstly computed, then the Brillouin spectrum along the fiber is divided into transition sub-images with large changes in Brillouin frequency shift (BFS) and non-transition sub-images with small changes in BFS, and finally the transition and non-transition sub-images are filtered with linear and non-linear filters, respectively. By using an 800m-length G657 sensing fiber with five temperature events in a proof-of-concept experiment, a BFS measurement accuracy improvement of 22% in non-transition section, and a spatial resolution (SR) enhancement of 84% in transition Section can be achieved by using the proposed BSP filter, compared to the results obtained by using non-local means (NLM) filter. Besides, a BFS measurement accuracy improvement of 54% in non-transition section, and a SR enhancement of 71% in transition section, can be achieved compared with the results obtained by using Gaussian filter. Moreover, to deal with the noisy Brillouin spectrum of the 800m-length fiber by using the proposed BSP filter, we obtain a processing time reduction of 37% compared with that by using NLM filter.

AB  - Rendering a high impedance on a series elastic actuator (SEA) can improve motion control performance while retaining collision safety by a lower physical stiffness. The safe impedance range can be increased with high-gain velocity feedback control, but, in practice, this is limited by noise. This article applies the noise reduction disturbance observer to inner-loop velocity control of an SEA, attenuating noise and allowing higher safe rendered stiffness compared with standard torque and torque/velocity hierarchical control. Closed-form expressions for maximum passive stiffness and $Z$-region are found, shown to depend strongly on the high-frequency noise gain, and used to optimize the control gains. Performance is experimentally verified on a reaction-force SEA, validating the passivity of the high-stiffness control in impact (free space and stiff environment) while rendering a safe stiffness 3.0 times the intrinsic stiffness.

AB  - This paper studies the problem of microphone array beamforming to enhance a speech signal of interest in adverse acoustic environments, where interference and additive background noise coexist. The problem is formulated as one of convex optimization whose solution under a specified level of interference attenuation leads to an interference controlled maximum noise reduction (ICMR) beamformer, which can be expressed as a linear combination of two MVDR beamformers: one attempts to extract the desired source signal while the other attempts to extract the interference. The combination coefficients are functions of the array manifold vectors, noise coherence matrix, and the specified interference attenuation factor. By tuning the interference attenuation factor, the ICMR beamformer can be implemented to achieve aggressive interference attenuation or even eliminate interference completely; but this may lead to less additive noise suppression or even noise amplification. To control the maximum sacrifice in gain (SG) of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) that is acceptable for additive reduction, a variant of ICMR is derived, which is named as the ICMR-SG beamformer. Simulations are performed and the results show that the ICMR beamformer is able to control the amount of interference attenuation. In comparison, ICMR-SG controls the maximum SG of SNR while achieving the optimal possible level of interference attenuation.

AB  - Self-homodyne optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) transmission system is a variant of self-coherent systems with a relaxed laser linewidth requirement as opposed to a full coherent system. The system is designed by transmitting a carrier together with the subcarriers, ensuring a strong phase-correlation between them at a receiver compared to the coherent system where only the subcarriers are transmitted. Despite the strong phase-correlation, the laser phase noise (PN) can still degrade the self-homodyne system performance due to the interaction of the PN with a chromatic dispersion (CD) induces a phase-modulation to intensity-modulation (PM-to-IM) conversion noise which cannot be canceled using a balanced-receiver. This imposes a high noise pedestal underneath each subcarrier, with the highest pedestal's peak imposed beneath the subcarriers that are farthest away from the carrier. This in turn produces a phase-decorrelation between the carrier and subcarriers which degrades the Q-factor between the lowest and highest subcarrier frequencies. In this work, the effect of the PM-to-IM conversion noise is reduced for the transmission of up to 174 Gb/s using a simple delay-line assigned to realign the phase-decorrelation of the subcarriers. With this technique, the subcarriers Q-degradation can be improved and the total transmission length can be tripled with Q-improvements of 5.4, 5.3, and 5-dB for 16-quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) over 1360 km, 32- QAM over 800 km, and 64-QAM over 480 km, respectively, using 10-MHz LW with a 15-GHz total signal bandwidth. For 29 GHz signal bandwidth, the phase-walk-off of the high frequency subcarrier becomes more severe where the introduced delay can increase the transmission length by 2.5 times than without the delay, which increased the signal tolerance to the conversion noise.

AB  - For hearing-impaired listeners, both ambient noise suppression and binaural cues preservation of directional sources are required, such that a complete spatial awareness of the acoustic scene can be obtained. It was shown that the binaural multichannel Wiener filter (MWF) with partial noise preservation can achieve joint noise reduction and binaural cues preservation and incorporating an external microphone signal improves the performance of binaural MWFs. Motivated by this, we propose a binaural MWF incorporating external wireless devices in this paper. First, we theoretically analyze the performance of the MWF in terms of output signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and binaural cues preservation errors. As in practice the external devices are power driven with a limited amount of battery resource and the power consumption heavily depends on the transmission rate, given an expected noise reduction performance we then optimize the bit-rate for a single external microphone. Further, we consider to minimize the total power consumption over multiple external devices under a constraint on the output SNR, which turns out to be a rate distribution problem. The proposed rate-distributed binaural MWF is evaluated using a hearing-aid setup with various dynamics. It is shown that the proposed method can obtain a desired SNR at a much lower bit-rate, and an expected trade-off between SNR gain and binaural cues preservation accuracy can be obtained by optimizing the bit-rates. Increasing the bit-rates improves both instrumental speech quality and speech intelligibility.

AB  - Distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) is widely recognized as a new technology to replace conventional geophones for the acquisition of seismic data. However, the collected data often contain a lot of coupled noise due to cable slapping and ringing along the borehole casing, which brings great difficulties to the interpretation of seismic data. The existing conventional coupled noise reduction methods often need to estimate the parameters of each coupled noise (such as amplitude, noise period, attenuation coefficient, etc.), which takes a lot of time and cannot meet the requirements for large-data-volume DAS seismic data processing. In addition, some deep learning-based denoising methods lack detailed analysis on coupled noise and have problems in the construction of training sets, resulting in insufficient generalization ability of the denoising model. To solve these problems, we propose a coupled noise reduction method based on the convolutional neural network (CNN). The proposed method does not need to estimate the parameters of coupled noise, and the denoising process is more convenient and efficient. In addition, through the analysis of DAS seismic data, we also construct a training set for coupled noise reduction using real data and synthetic data. The denoising results of both synthetic data and field data show that the proposed method can effectively reduce the coupled noise in DAS seismic data, and the effective signal has almost no energy loss. After processing, the signal affected by coupled noise becomes clear and continuous, providing high-quality data support for subsequent interpretation.

AB  - Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is the pertinent waveform for current and next generation wireless systems, whose spectral efficiency can be potentially doubled by in-band full-duplex (IBFD) communication. However, in OFDM based IBFD systems, digital self-interference cancellation (DSIC) employed at baseband does not provide sufficient cancellation in the cyclic prefix (CP) region. When the propagation delay between two communicating radios is non-zero, the CP noise affects the data region of the desired signal. In this work, we propose CP noise reduction (CPNR) technique for OFDM based IBFD radios. We have evaluated CPNR with time and frequency domain DSIC schemes via both simulations and MATLAB and FPGA implementations on our Software Defined Radio based IBFD radio. In the laboratory tests, the total suppression of the IBFD radio is improved by 6 dB by employing CPNR in frequency-domain DSIC and EVM for bidirectional communication is improved by up to 5%, allowing realistic propagation delays. In addition to improving the total suppression and EVM performance, CPNR is also shown to enhance the multi-path resiliency of DSIC techniques.

AB  - An improved current profile selection for noise reduction of a switched reluctance motor (SRM) during middle-speed operation is presented with the principle of flattening the three-phase radial force sum. The improved current is selected from the proposed algorithm, which considers the limited input voltage and back electromotive force influence at middle-speed operation. The improved current profile is compared with the single pulse current, which is the typical current for SRMs at middle-speed operation. The analysis results show that the variation of the radial force sum by the improved current profile is less than that of the single pulse current, although the influence of the back electromotive force is high. The effectiveness of radial force sum flattening is verified by the experimental results. The experiments were carried out with the downscaled operating point of a SRM owing to the limited range of the operating speed. The experiment results show a significant reduction in the highest and second-highest peak noises at 5.4 and 1.8 kHz by 11.04 and 17.51 dB, respectively, with the improved current profile. The other noises were also reduced.

AB  - For hearing-impaired listeners, it is required not only to enhance the target speech by suppressing ambient noises, but also to preserve the binaural cues of important directional sources, such that a complete spatial awareness of the acoustic scene is obtained. It was shown that the binaural minimum variance distortionless response (BMVDR) filter enables a joint enhancement and binaural cue preservation of the target source. By adding more linear constraints associated with the acoustic transfer functions of noise sources to BMVDR, the binaural linearly constrained minimum variance (BLCMV) filter is obtained, which can further preserve the spatial cues of interfering sources at the cost of sacrificing the noise reduction performance. Both BMVDR and BLCMV beamformers enforce a hard decision on the spatial awareness. In this paper, we therefore propose a generalization for BMVDR and BLCMV, namely parametric unconstrained binaural (PUB) beamformer, which can achieve a controllable soft decision on noise reduction and binaural cues preservation. The involved parameters are chosen to control the distortion level of the target source and the preservation of interfering sources, respectively. Theoretical analysis on the performance comparison shows that the conventional BMVDR and BLCMV beamformers are special cases of the PUB beamformer. Experiments using both synthetic data and real audio measurements validate the superiority of the proposed method.

AB  - The use of helium recycling systems for magnetoencephalography (MEG) has rapidly expanded in recent years. Placing the cryocooler close to the MEG cryostat is expected to aid in achieving a high helium-recycling efficiency. However, the cryocooler typically introduces a large amount of magnetic interference in the MEG system owing to mechanical vibration, and electric and magnetic noise. In this study, we proposed a mobile reference sensor method using fluxgate magnetometers and vibration meters to reduce the noise originating from the cryocooler. We placed the MEG cryostat, which included superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID)-based MEG sensors and reference magnetometers, and a pulse-tube cryocooler inside a magnetically shielded room. We recorded the vibration and magnetic noise during the operation of the cryocooler using the vibration meters and fluxgate magnetometers placed on the cryocooler and reference SQUID magnetometers as the reference noise data. A noise reduction algorithm named time-shift principal component analysis (TSPCA) was applied to the recorded MEG sensor data by employing the reference noise data. A noise reduction ratio of –39 dB was achieved without temporal and spatial distortion of the MEG signal using an MEG phantom. Thus, we conclude that the mobile reference sensor method with the TSPCA algorithm is an effective technique for reducing the magnetic noise originating from the cryocooler.

AB  - The cavitation flow of the cartridge pilot-operated relief valve’s main valve port was numerically simulated and studied using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) in our research, and the relief valve structure was modified to decrease cavitation noise. These findings indicate that cavitation in the relief valve occurs primarily downstream of the main valve port and is linked to the wall. The cavitation generation is influenced by the jet at the valve port. The closer the high-speed jet at the valve port is to the valve’s inner wall, the more readily cavitation occurs. Conversely, less cavitation is observed. This paper reports the effects of the forms and parameters of the main port structure on the jet angle and morphology of cavitation. The annular groove structure of the spool has a considerable influence on the cavitation attached to the spool and the valve sleeve wall, whereas the outlet position of the relief valve mostly affects the intensity of cavitation near the valve sleeve wall. Based on this, an optimized structure of the relief valve was designed, with which the maximum vapor volume fraction and total vapor volume of the cavitation flow were considerably decreased for various inlet pressures and spool openings. The experimental results show that, following optimization, the noise of the relief valve drops dramatically, confirming that optimizing the structure has a beneficial impact on decreasing cavitation noise.

AB  - Microwave photonic applications such as beamforming and filtering entail the photonic summation of optically-carried RF signals. The most commonly used components to perform these functions are fiber-optic couplers, arrayed waveguide gratings and optical concentrators, whose common characteristic is to gather these optical signals on a single output before converting them into an RF signal with a photodiode. The spatial superposition of several optical fields causes photonic interference leading to the emergence of noise in the RF domain. This paper focuses on an experimental study of the impact of optical interference and phase decorrelation between delayed optical fields in an optical fiber interferometer, considering two different combining technologies. When a fiber coupler is employed, the full overlap of the spatial fields induces a high-level noise on the electrical signal generated after the photodiode. To solve this problem, the use of a microwave photonic summation device based on an optical power concentrator and a high-speed planar photodiode permits a strong mitigation of the optical interference. The results of the experiments presented reveal that the proposed approach can reduce phase noise effects on the resulting electrical sum signal by a factor of 40 dB.

AB  - This brief describes an efficient way to reduce the quantization noise of delta-sigma fractional-N PLLs by using an injection-locked oscillator (ILO) in the feedback path. For further noise reduction, the use of cascaded ILOs is proposed. Behaving like a type-I high-order PLL, the cascaded ILOs effectively suppress the quantization noise like a high-order phase-domain low-pass filter (PDLPF). We show that the proposed ILO-based PDLPF significantly improves the out-of-band phase noise for wideband fractional-N PLLs as well as the in-band phase noise for fractional-N bang-bang PLLs (BBPLLs). Post-layout simulation results show that a  $\Delta \Sigma $  fractional-N BBPLL with a 3-stage ILO can achieve the in-band noise reduction of 25 dB without having a nested PLL.

AB  - Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) based sensors are commonly applied to detect molecular interactions from features extracted of the so-called SPR curve. The SPR curve represents the position of the resonance occurrence, and reflects the quality of the sensor measurements. The instrumentation used in the SPR sensors require very specific coupling conditions for optical-electronic, mechanical, and fluidic components to properly excitate the surface plasmons. Noise sources inherent to the sensor instrumentation are reflected in the SPR curve and affect the quality of its extracted features. A smart-filter based on multilayer artificial neural networks is designed to eliminate the main instrumental noise sources and noise due to sensing proceedings at the SPR sensor usage, which are perceived as distortions in the SPR curves. The filter, called NNSF, is embedded to SPR sensors operating in both spectral (WIM) and angular (AIM) interrogation modes, and achieved responses with a mean square error of 10-5, and tested model correlation indexes over 90%. The filter redressed noises, including artifacts such as metal-layer roughness, light source input angle/wavelength disagreements, prism birefringence and general oscillations in amplitude and phase of the curve due to no-rigorous control process in the environment and experimental routines. Thus, the NNSF delivers curves with enhanced features and consequently increases the sensor performances in the monitoring of the resonance features (Width, Energy, Phase, Asymmetry, and minimum Position). Furthermore, the proposed filter avoids replacement or incorporation of new components that cause considerable instrumental maintenance cost.

AB  - In many high-performance compact air-cooling technologies, it is desirable to adopt materials that provide combined heat dissipation with noise reduction (NR) in the same device. A device that adopts such material is termed here as a “noise-reducing heat sink” (NRHS). NRHS design would involve fundamental thermal-acoustic performance tradeoffs, thus necessitating investigation of their combined thermal-acoustic performance. In this article, the thermal-acoustic performance of NRHS is evaluated by determining their thermal-acoustic index (TAI) as a function of airflow rates (Mach number <; 0.1). This index is determined by combining thermal resistance as the basis for thermal performance characterization and NR improvement to characterize the acoustic performance. Conventional parallel-plate heat sinks/slit-based geometries, stochastic metal foams, and a designed periodic foam structure are compared as NRHS candidates. The results show that, for the same material volume fraction, stochastic metal foam heat sinks have better combined thermal-acoustic performance compared with a conventional parallel-plate heat sink. A designed periodic foam NRHS is shown to have significantly improved TAI, thus leading the way for NRHS design in compact cooling technologies. For the best combined thermal and acoustic performance, laminar flow is identified as a suitable operational flow regime.

AB  - This paper addresses the influence reduction of quantization and observation noises in a disturbance observer (DOB) technique. DOB is a disturbance estimation method that makes control systems robust. However, in implementing low-resolution sensors, disturbance estimates from DOB are considerably influenced by observation and quantization noises. In this paper, a novel DOB design method for simultaneous estimation of state and unknown disturbances, including the reduction of noise influences, is proposed. The proposed method is divided into two components. The first component is a Kalman filter (KF)-based DOB for simultaneous estimation of state and unknown disturbances. To improve the estimation performance through the KF-based DOB, a forgetting factor-based adaptive KF (FAKF) was employed. The second component is an adaptive law for the forgetting factor in the FAKF. The adaptive law is used for balancing the estimation accuracy and observation noise reduction. Simulation results involving various types of noise environments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB  - Over the years, a fixed window for smoothing radiometer cold-space and warm-load counts and processing brightness temperature in calibration has been used for all microwave sounders at European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) and NOAA. Although this practice is based on ground tests and legacy satellites, it remains unclear if this empirical parameter is optimal for in-orbit radiometers, as the space environment is different from the ground and radiometers may drift. We found that the fixed window is not optimal and leads to large noise. We have developed an adaptive window that accommodates channel differences and temporal changes in hardware. Our method has reduced noise by as much as 50% for 183 GHz channels of MetOp-C microwave humidity sounder (MHS). We observed temporal jumps and shifts in counts, gain, and noise of 89 and 190 GHz, and accordingly, the adaptive window can adjust to reduce such an impact. Further analyses reveal that  $1/f$  noise plays an important role for determining the adaptive window.  $1/f$  noise is nonstationary and gives rise to the fluctuation of counts and gain. As a result, for channels with large  $1/f$  noise a short window should be used to mitigate the fluctuation. Our study suggests that an adaptive method has advantages over the fixed method for considering channel differences and time-varying noise.

AB  - Operating semiconductor quantum dots as quantum bits requires isolating single electrons by adjusting gate voltages. The transitions of electrons to and from the dots appear as a honeycomb-like pattern in recorded charge stability diagrams (CSDs). Thus, detecting the pattern is essential to tune a double dot, but manual tuning is seriously time-consuming. However, automation of this process is difficult because the transitions’ contrast is often low, and noise and background disorder potential shifts disturb the CSDs. Therefore, the signal-to-noise ratio needs to be increased to improve the detection of the line pattern. For this purpose, we evaluate a representative set of edge-preserving smoothing filters and compare them both quantitatively and qualitatively by suitable metrics and visual assessment. We generate artificial data to use full-reference metrics for the evaluation procedure and to optimize the filter parameters. Based on the results of this article, the methods attain a moderate to good amount of noise reduction and structure improvement dependent on the different CSD qualities. In conclusion, we suggest introducing the block-matching and three-dimensional transform-domain filter into the automated tuning processing pipeline. If the data are corrupted by significant amounts of random telegraph noise, the bilateral filter and the rolling guidance filter are also good choices.

AB  - Low light images suffer from a low dynamic range and severe noise due to low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In this paper, we propose joint contrast enhancement and noise reduction of low light images via just-noticeable-difference (JND) transform. We adopt the JND transform to achieve both contrast enhancement and noise reduction based on human visual perception. First, we generate a JND map based on an the human visual system (HVS) response model from foreground and background luminance, called JND transform. Second, for base image, we perform perceptual contrast enhancement based on luminance adaptation to effectively allocate a dynamic range to each gray level while preventing under enhancement (tone distortion) and over-enhancement. Third, we refine the JND map using Weber's law, luminance adaptation and visual masking. Weber's law enhances the JND map based on the luminance variation after contrast enhancement. Luminance adaptation suppresses noise for smooth regions, while visual masking enforces detail enhancement for textural regions. Fourth, we perform inverse JND transform to generate the enhanced luma channel from the JND map and base image. Finally, we conduct chroma denoising by transferring texture information of the enhanced luma channel to the chroma channels with guided filtering. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves both contrast enhancement and noise reduction for low light images as well as outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of quantitative measurements.

AB  - The thermal sensitivity and Low Frequency Noise (LFN) of compensation doped Silicon-On-Insulator (SOI) resistors are studied experimentally, down to the cryogenic regime. A high compensation nominal ratio K = NA/ND of 0.82 is compared with uncompensated and partially compensated configurations, using Phosphorus and Boron as dopant species. The Temperature Coefficient of Resistance (TCR) reaches -2.7%/K at 80 K, for an effective compensation ratio close to 0.98 considering incomplete dopant ionization. The measurements reveal a low LFN with a nearly frequency-independent spectrum, far from the classical 1/f trend observed in uncompensated silicon. The mean value of the Hooge constant on the highly compensated silicon sample equals 3.15 × 10-4 at 300 K and 4.50 × 10-5 at 80 K. The normalized LFN at 80 K does not depend on the resistor length and thereby seems independent of the volume. Such high performance thermistors represent an attractive, mature and affordable solution for high performance thermal sensing.

AB  - In-band full-duplex (IBFD) systems are attracting attention as a key technology for ideally doubling channel capacity for beyond 5G and 6G. First, we propose an analytical model of the effect of  $N$ -bit analog-to-digital converter (A/D) quantization noise on channel capacity quasi-upper limit of the desired signal at the base station of the IBFD systems. We derive averaged and peak powers of input signal to  $N$ -bit A/D and quantization noise power of  $N$ -bit A/D to formulate uplink (UL) channel capacity quasi-upper limit. Numerical analysis results by the proposed analytical model show that the UL channel capacity quasi-upper limit degrades by 16% and 80% in the 12- and 8-bit A/D, respectively. Second, we propose digital signal-processing (DSP)-assisted dual- and quad-A/Ds to reduce the quantization noise effect in IBFD systems. When A/D resolution bit is 8-bit, the proposed DSP-assisted dual- and quad-A/Ds improve the UL channel capacity quasi-upper limit by up to 92.3 and 192%, respectively, compared to conventional A/D for peak-to-average power ratio condition of 15 dB and analog self-interference (SI) cancellation capability of 30 dB. The proposed dual- and quad-A/Ds can reduce the burden on the analog SI cancellation circuitry by 6 and 12 dB, respectively.

AB  - Contrast optimization is a key issue in polarimetric imaging for the purpose of target detection. In practice, the noise could induce the intensity fluctuation of the image and thus lead to the decrease of the image contrast. A joint noise reduction method is proposed for contrast enhancement in Stokes polarimetric imaging. The proposed method is based on the relation of the joint polarimetric image set, which includes four images taken to calculate Stokes vector and one image taken at the optimal state of a polarization state analyzer (PSA). By our method, the traditional contrast-enhanced image is modified to decrease the disturbance of noise, and the contrast of the image is further enhanced. Both the theoretical analysis and the real-world experimental results demonstrate that our method can effectively decrease the disturbance by the noise and thus increase the contrast of the image. In particular, it is found that the effect of the proposed method is independent of the optimal PSA state when the regular tetrahedron measurement matrix is implemented.

AB  - It is crucial to retain as many signal components as possible, while noise is eliminated for wavelet packet noise reduction algorithms. Conventional thresholding functions take coefficients smaller than a given threshold as the noise component and get them removed in many ways. In this letter, considering the potential probability of being the signal-related component of coefficients whose value is smaller than the given threshold and the nonnegligible fact that microseismic (MS) event is sparse compared with the noise, we proposed a new wavelet packet-based denoising method via fuzzy partition. First, instead of a hard partition from a given threshold, wavelet packet coefficients get reduced by a fuzzy partition to retain more potential signal elements and suppress the noise. Second, we employ fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering to identify the interval period of the MS event further to remove the residual noise and additional resonance in processed time series. We tested our method on synthetic datasets and real-field data from an MS monitoring experiment in a coal mine in Sichuan Basin, China. We utilize Pearson correlation coefficient and root-mean-square error between ideal signal and denoised data as performance indicators in synthetic tests, while sample entropy and kurtosis of denoised data are involved in the real field dataset. Test results from synthetic datasets and the real field dataset demonstrate that the proposed noise reduction method is superior to traditional hard-, soft-, and garrote-thresholding and is more applicable and effective in MS data processing.

AB  - In this paper, the design of multichannel noise reduction filters in the short-time-Fourier-transform (STFT) domain is addressed. By investigating the structure of the linear filter, a set of multichannel iterative noise reduction filters are developed based on the Kronecker product decomposition. Instead of computing a long noise reduction filter, we compute three much shorter sub-filters which are separately applied in the spatial, temporal and frequency dimensions. Consequently, compared with the traditional multichannel STFT-domain noise reduction filters, the proposed approaches have two advantages: 1) significantly lower computational complexity; 2) less past observations are needed to construct the iterative filters, which leads to better tracking ability for the temporal/spatial signal nonstationarity. Experimental results demonstrate the advantages of the developed iterative filters over the traditional ones.

AB  - This article proposes a unique control strategy for a deadbeat multiple vector finite-set model predictive current control with an embedded integral action (MV-FMPC) for permanent magnet synchronous motor drives. Torque ripple and phase current distortions in permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) drives are minimized with the proposed controller by adopting the multiple vector approach to the finite-set model predictive control. The controller uses a hexagonal co-ordinate system to simplify the location and identification of the virtual vectors created, thereby eliminating the use of large look-up tables and reducing computational burden. When used with the proposed deadbeat prediction model, the overall steady-state performance, system robustness, and quality of disturbance rejection are improved compared to the state-of-the-art finite-set model predictive current control (FS-MPC) methods with pulsewidth modulation. The improvements are due to the modified deadbeat prediction model with integral action, the algorithm used for multiple virtual voltage identification and the retention of the cost function in the proposed method. The proposed deadbeat MV-FMPC method and its improvements over the conventional FS-MPC have been verified through simulation and experiments with an interior-type permanent magnet synchronous machine.

AB  - Over the years, several algorithms for discretization have been devised, but the problem of efficient, accurate discretization still remains an open problem. This paper proposes a novel discretization algorithm, called SPID5, based on combination of two heuristics, one being local and the other global, both being supervised and their combination resulting in a significant synergy. The local heuristic is the well-known information gain of the continuous attributes, and the global heuristic is a novel concept of iterative reduction of noise in the data set. The reduction of noise is achieved by reducing successively pseudo deletion count of the data set to be discretized. The performance of SPID5 algorithm is compared with that of three well-known and time-tested discretization algorithms, using six state-of-the-art classifiers and 35 real-world data sets from the standard UCI data repository. Performance of SPID5 compares favorably with that of all the three existing discretization algorithms it is compared with, not only in terms of classification accuracy but also in terms of noise reduction in the data sets.

AB  - The noise level in a tractor cab directly affects the driving experience. Reducing the noise level in a tractor cab is an important means of improving the image of the product brand and protecting the physical and psychological health of employees. To reduce medium- and low-frequency noise in a tractor cab, the influence of the installation of coupled resonance acoustic materials (CRAMs) on tractor driver ear noise is investigated in this study. Theories for sound absorption by perforated plates and sound insulation by thin membranes are used to design a CRAM composed of a perforated plate, elastic membrane and additional mass. The acoustic impedance and sound absorption coefficient of the CRAM are obtained by an equivalent circuit method, and the resonance frequency of a local resonance system composed of an elastic membrane and additional mass is calculated. The effects of different hole diameters and porosities of the perforated plate on the CRAM sound absorption coefficient are compared. The results of tests performed using impedance tubes over a wide frequency range of 50 Hz~1600 Hz show that the maximum sound absorption coefficient is 0.99 and several transmission loss peaks of 15 dB~26 dB. Measurement of the acoustic response of the CRAM installed on the cab front panel shows that an ear noise reduction of approximately 1.3 dB(A) for a tractor working speed of 2200 rpm. The results show that the designed CRAM has a relatively good effect on reducing driver ear noise over a wide frequency band and is a feasible scheme for noise reduction in a tractor cab.

AB  - Aiming at the problem of temperature measurement error caused by the noise signal on the Raman-based distributed optical fiber temperature sensor (RDTS), a noise reduction method based on the improved complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise, fuzzy entropy, and the wavelet soft threshold denoising (ICEEMDAN-FE-WSTD) is proposed. First, ICEEMDAN is used to decompose the input signal, and noise intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) are determined by calculating the FE value of each IMF. Then, noise IMFs are denoised by the WSTD method. Finally, the noise reduction results are obtained by combining the denoised IMFs with the remaining useful signal IMFs for reconstruction. The advantages of the proposed method in terms of denoising and character extraction are verified by the simulation signal experiment with different signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). The temperature measurement experiments are carried out with heating areas set at 40 °C, 45 °C, 50 °C, 55 °C, and 60 °C. Taking the 40 °C temperature measurement experiment as an example, after the temperature measurement signal is denoised by the proposed method, the maximum temperature measurement error in the heating area is reduced by 1.07 °C, the SNR is increased by 4.83 dB, and the root-mean-square error (RMSE) is reduced by 0.77. The temperature drift of RDTS signals after noise reduction by the proposed method is also effectively suppressed, and the maximum temperature measurement error at 2.28 km is reduced by 1.43 °C. The denoising results of the proposed method are compared with the other six noise reduction methods in this article, and the proposed method has the best performance.

AB  - Alternating current (ac)/ Direct current (dc) power converters with dc-bus filters can achieve high power density, however, it was found in this article that the reverse recovery currents of the 50/60 Hz diode bridge can lead to significant electromagnetic interference (EMI) noise violating EMI standards above 150 kHz. This article analyzed and quantified the mechanism of the EMI generation due to the reverse recovery currents of the 50/60 Hz diodes. It was found that although the reverse recovery of the 50/60 Hz diode bridge repeats at a frequency of 50/60 Hz, the EMI can be very high above 150 kHz due to the operating principle of electromagnetic compatibility spectrum analyzers. Two techniques were proposed to reduce the EMI due to the reverse recovery of the diode bridge. The analyses were validated by either simulations or experiments.

AB  - Distant supervision is widely used to extract relational facts with automatically labeled datasets to reduce high cost of human annotation. However, current distantly supervised methods suffer from the common problems of word-level and sentence-level noises, which come from a large proportion of irrelevant words in a sentence and inaccurate relation labels for numerous sentences. The problems lead to unacceptable precision in relation extraction and are critical for the success of using distant supervision. In this paper, we propose a novel and robust neural approach to deal with both problems by reducing influences of the multi-granularity noises. Three levels of noises from word, sentence until knowledge type are carefully considered in this work. We first initiate a question-answering based relation extractor (QARE) to remove noisy words in a sentence. Then we use multi-focus multi-instance learning (MMIL) to alleviate the effects of sentence-level noise by utilizing wrongly labeled sentences properly. Finally, to enhance our method against all the noises, we initialize parameters in our method with a priori knowledge learned from the relevant task of entity type classification by transfer learning. Extensive experiments on both existing benchmark and an improved larger dataset demonstrate that our proposed approach remarkably achieves new state-of-the-art performance.

AB  - As an essential reprocessing method, dimensionality reduction (DR) can reduce the data redundancy and improve the performance of hyperspectral image (HSI) classification. A novel unsupervised DR framework with feature interpretability, which integrates both band selection (BS) and spatial noise reduction method, is proposed to extract low-dimensional spectral–spatial features of HSI. We proposed a new neighborhood grouping normalized matched filter (NGNMF) for BS, which can reduce the data dimension while preserving the corresponding spectral information. An enhanced 2-D singular spectrum analysis (E2DSSA) method is also proposed to extract the spatial context and structural information from each selected band, aiming to decrease the intraclass variability and reduce the effect of noise in the spatial domain. The support vector machine (SVM) classifier is used to evaluate the effectiveness of the extracted spectral–spatial low-dimensional features. Experimental results on three publicly available HSI datasets have fully demonstrated the efficacy of the proposed NGNMF-E2DSSA method, which has surpassed a number of state-of-the-art DR methods.

AB  - Encoding-decoding (ED) CNNs have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance for noise reduction over the past years. This has triggered the pursuit of better understanding the inner workings of such architectures, which has led to the theory of deep convolutional framelets (TDCF), revealing important links between signal processing and CNNs. Specifically, the TDCF demonstrates that ReLU CNNs induce low-rankness, since these models often do not satisfy the necessary redundancy to achieve perfect reconstruction (PR). In contrast, this paper explores CNNs that do meet the PR conditions. We demonstrate that in these type of CNNs soft shrinkage and PR can be assumed. Furthermore, based on our explorations we propose the learned wavelet-frame shrinkage network, or LWFSN and its residual counterpart, the rLWFSN. The ED path of the (r)LWFSN complies with the PR conditions, while the shrinkage stage is based on the linear expansion of thresholds proposed Blu and Luisier. In addition, the LWFSN has only a fraction of the training parameters (<1%) of conventional CNNs, very small inference times, low memory footprint, while still achieving performance close to state-of-the-art alternatives, such as the tight frame (TF) U-Net and FBPConvNet, in low-dose CT denoising.

AB  - The noise is the most common issue present in all signals. Depending on the process or application, the reduction of the noise is mandatory mainly in areas such as signal classification, pattern recognition, and training process, among others. In recent years, diverse methodologies for noise reduction have been proposed, but they have left some issues with no solution. Such are the noise reduction in signals immersed in white noise without changes in their amplitude or phase or the high performance of recovering components of the desire signals distributed among the frequency spectrum. Also, filtering techniques without significant changes in signal phase and amplitude are necessary. This article proposes a methodology for noise reduction based on the orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm with dictionaries constructed from kernel functions of the discrete cosine transform and discrete sine transform. The methodology is proved in synthetic signals and real electrical signals, reaching noise reduction of white noise (~34 dB in electrical signals) and recovering without distortion.

AB  - Due to the leakage vibration signal of the water-supply pipeline is easily interfered with by background noise, which leads to a significant leakage location error of time delay estimation. The complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN) and independent component analysis (ICA) combined noise reduction method based on cross-spectral analysis is proposed and applied to leak location of water supply pipelines. Firstly, determine the frequency band range of the source leakage signal by cross-spectral analysis of the leakage vibration signal. At the same time, the leakage vibration signal is decomposed into a finite number of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) using CEEMDAN. Then, the IMF components are filtered according to the effective amplitude ratio criterion, and the filtered components are reconstructed into a virtual noise channel. Finally, the leakage vibration signal and virtual noise channel are unmixed using FastICA to obtain the best estimate of the source leakage signal, which is used to estimate time delay using cross-correlation for determining the leak location. Simulation and experimental results show that the proposed method effectively improves the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and time delay estimation accuracy, and reduces leak location error. Compared with cross-correlation, CEEMDAN-ICA based on correlation coefficients, and CEEMDAN based on cross-spectral analysis, the average relative positioning error of the proposed method is respectively reduced by 11.07%, 9.7%, and 1.8%. In addition, the superiority of the proposed method compared with other state-of-the-art noise reduction methods is verified by comparative experiments.

AB  - Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) images inevitably suffer from multiplicative speckle noise caused by random interference. This study proposes an unsupervised domain adaptation approach for noise reduction by translating the SD-OCT to the corresponding high-quality enhanced depth imaging (EDI)-OCT. We propose a structure-persevered cycle-consistent generative adversarial network for unpaired image-to-image translation, which can be applied to imbalanced unpaired data, and can effectively preserve retinal details based on a structure-specific cross-domain description. It also imposes smoothness by penalizing the intensity variation of the low reflective region between consecutive slices. Our approach was tested on a local data set that consisted of 268 SD-OCT volumes and two public independent validation datasets including 20 SD-OCT volumes and 17 B-scans, respectively. Experimental results show that our method can effectively suppress noise and maintain the retinal structure, compared with other traditional approaches and deep learning methods in terms of qualitative and quantitative assessments. Our proposed method shows good performance for speckle noise reduction and can assist downstream tasks of OCT analysis.

AB  - This article presents a PCB winding coupled inductor design for both high efficiency and effective common-mode (CM) noise reduction in a silicon carbide (SiC)-based soft-switching three-phase ac–dc converter. A balance technique is applied to reduce the CM noise, creating a return path with additional inductors. The inductors in the main circuit and return path are coupled in one core and implemented with PCB windings. A winding interleaving structure with strong coupling between the main inductors is selected to minimize the winding loss and to improve the converter efficiency; however, the interwinding capacitance brought on by the winding interleaving worsens the CM noise. An inductor model including the capacitance is introduced, and its impact on the CM noise is analyzed. A novel inductor structure is proposed to scale back the interwinding capacitance and to enhance the CM noise reduction capability. Experiments with a SiC-based 25-kW soft-switching three-phase ac–dc converter prototype validates the performances of the proposed PCB winding coupled inductors.

AB  - The low-frequency seismic noise has partially overlapping frequency band and similar waveform with seismic signals, making identification of seismic signals difficult in the seismic data at low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). For improving the quality of seismic data, a deep complex reaction–diffusion (DCRD) model is proposed by combining the convolutional neural network (CNN) with the complex shock diffusion (CSD) which consists of a diffusion term and a shock term. By introducing a reaction term with an adjustable weight into the CSD, the CNN model can be embedded to learn the reaction term, leading to more effective signal preservation. The DCRD feeds smoothed signal components to the evolution process, by fusing the intermediate result based on low-level seismic features of data to be processed and the result of CNN model that learns deep seismic features. Moreover, the learnable reaction term facilitates the DCRD to apply effective diffusion for filtering out low-frequency seismic noise with spatiotemporally variable levels. Finally, the diffusion and shock terms in the DCRD can adjust the deviation of CNN model when the noise statistics of noisy seismic data having spatiotemporally variable levels deviate from training data, which also expand the practical application of CNN model. The DCRD is tested on synthetic and field seismic data and the results demonstrate that the DCRD achieves a great performance in suppressing low-frequency seismic noise with spatiotemporally variable levels and preserving seismic signals.

AB  - An energy storage system (ESS) requires high reliability with low electromagnetic (EM) interference, communication capability between ESS applications, and bidirectional power conversion for charging and discharging operations. However, a conventional ESS separately has power converters, communication devices, and large-sized EM interference filters for its stable operation. In this article, a current-fed capacitor-inductor-inductor-capacitor (CLLC) resonant converter employing asymmetric pulsewidth modulation and spread spectrum modulation is proposed to obtaining three functions, bidirectional power conversion with tight output voltage regulation, EM noise mitigation, and power line communication capability among ESSs, simultaneously. It can improve the cost-effectiveness, system's form factor, and communication flexibility. The proposed integration of three functionalities has design constraints on the implementation of each function. Design methodologies of power stage and control algorithm are also proposed for achieving the simultaneous operation of each function. The performance of the proposed converter and control algorithm are verified through a 20-W prototype converter.

AB  - Reducing the adverse effects of noises is one of the key issues for successful signal processing. For decades, there have been numerous studies to achieve this goal. Among them, dual-sensor noise reduction has been widely studied due to its rather high performance with comparatively low cost. In this paper, we propose a novel dual–sensor noise reduction method named a determinant-based generalized sidelobe canceller. As given in the graphical abstract, it is a two-stage noise reduction technique, wherein an input signal is primarily filtered by a determinant-based Wiener filter and then a subsequent noise canceller removes residual noises by utilizing the determinant-based adaptation mode controller. To update the coefficients of the noise canceller for noise-only regions, the output of the more reliable determinant-based signal activity detector is employed. For performance evaluation, five objective measures, the mean opinion score, and spectrograms of the proposed and other competing methods are estimated for both simulation and real data sets. Through the evaluation, we demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the others in almost all aspects, especially when multiple noises interfere or reverberation exists.

AB  - Comparing with the application of charge coupled device (CCD) sensor, a kind of interference stripe noise (ISN) can be observed easily from the complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) sensor-based digital holographic measurement (DHM) system because a series of optic coatings and filters are used in front of that sensor in order to improve its imaging effect. The improper assembly or the micro manufacturing error of these optic components may create the unexpected interference phenomena in the imaging sensor. To reduce that noise, an effective image processing method is developed. On one hand the Laplacian pyramid method is used to highlight the ISN and a cartoon-texture decomposition technique is carried out to remove the additive ISN. On the other hand, an improved Lee filtering is performed to restrain the multiplicative ISN. Extensive experiment results have shown that the image quality can be improved after the ISN reduction and this method is fit for solving a deionized water temperature estimation application where the texture complexity of target image is relatively low.

AB  - Phase noise reduction is one of the key steps for synthetic aperture radar interferometry data processing. In this article, a novel phase filtering method is proposed. The main innovation and contribution of this research is to 1) incorporate local fringe frequency (LFF) compensation technique into the nonlocal phase filtering method to include more independent and identically distributed samples for filtering; 2) modify the nonlocal phase filter from three aspects: 1) executing nonlocal filtering in the complex domain of the residual phase to avoid gray jumps in phase, 2) adaptively calculating the smoothing parameter based on the LFF and the coherence coefficient, and 3) using the integral image in similarity calculation to improve the efficiency; 3) perform Goldstein filter in high coherence areas to reduce the computation expense. Experiments based on both simulated and real data have shown that the proposed method has achieved a better performance in terms of both noise reduction and edge preservation than some existing phase filtering methods.

AB  - Spread spectrum clocking (SSC) conventionally uses frequency modulation (FM) to suppress digital switching noise in the frequency domain. While clock-FM effectively reduces spectral noise peaks, it maintains the synchronous operation per cycle with total noise unchanged. In this paper, we introduce plesiochronous design as a general applicable de-synchronization solution for the spectral switching noise optimization with guaranteed quality-of-service. By modeling on-chip aperiodic supply current as a poly-cyclostationary random process, we theoretically prove that digital plesiochronous design contributes to reducing both, total and peak switching noise, in a harmonic frequency band of interest logarithmically proportional to the number of adopted clock domains over the synchronous baseline. A complete framework is also developed to implement plesiochronous design with the optimal clock domain partitioning and FIFO-based synchronization that features a minimum depth of six by employing Johnson encoding fully compatible with mainstream design flow. Validated on a 130nm pipelined FFT test chip across 25 dies thus taking process variations into account, our plesiochronous SSC achieves on average 5.1dB total power reductions in addition to 12.8dB peak power reductions of substrate noise at the clock fundamental frequency, which match our predictions, with only marginal hardware overhead in terms of cell area and power consumption.

AB  - In this article, a 90°-bent differential transmission line using the asymmetric periodic structure filter is proposed. The asymmetry of the periodic structure filter is used to reduce the differential-to-common mode conversion while the frequency response of the periodic structure filter is used to reflect the common-mode noise. As compared with the conventional 90°-bent differential transmission line, the differential-to-common mode conversion is greatly reduced from −3.04 to −20.42 dB while the time-domain differential-to-common mode transmission is greatly reduced from 0.094 to 0.006 V. Besides, the common-mode reflection coefficient is largely increased from −13.72 to −0.94 dB while the time-domain common-mode reflection is largely increased from 0.017 to 0.068 V. Furthermore, the performance of the eye diagram is upgraded, meaning that the signal integrity is improved.

AB  - The vision recognition module is one of the very important modules in the normal operation of the intelligent plant cultivation robot. In the original vision module, by improving the original YOLOV3(The algorithm proposed in YOLOv3: An Incremental Improvement), a more excellent YOLOV3 was obtained to recognize plants under normal conditions. However, the improved YOLOV3 does not perform well in the visual recognition process when there is a lot of noise interference. To make the visual recognition module continue to work properly, in this paper, the better Cycle GAN (generative adversarial networks) model is proposed to deal with noise based on three common noises, and finally, through a lot of experiments, it is proved that the improvement has some significance for the vision recognition module, which extends the use of the vision recognition module and makes the intelligent plant cultivation robot avoid the interference of noise.

AB  - The phase-sensitive optical time domain reflectometry ( $\Phi $ -OTDR) system has been gradually applied to vertical seismic profile exploration due to its excellent anti-electromagnetic interference, extremely high resolution and sensitivity, and wide detection range. However, the actual data is often disturbed by random noise, which seriously affects the system’s ability to recognize low-frequency disturbances. In order to suppress the background noise and improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), a fusion noise reduction method based on empirical mode decomposition and time-frequency peak filtering (EMD-TFPF) algorithm is studied and introduced. In terms of seismic exploration data processing, the algorithm has good denoising performance. Using the  $\Phi $ -OTDR system based on optical synchronous reference heterodyne detection as the experimental platform, the EMD-TFPF noise reduction algorithm is applied to the position information and compared with the VSS-NLMS, VMD-NWT and EMD-soft methods. Experimental results show that under the conditions of 0.1 Hz and 5 V vibration interference, the EMD-TFPF method improves the SNR to 37.6 dB, which is much higher than the other three noise reduction algorithms. In addition, this method broadens the low-frequency response range of the system to 10−5 Hz. The improvement of the system’s ability to recognize low-frequency disturbance events will undoubtedly accelerate the practical process of the  $\Phi $ -OTDR system in seismic exploration.

AB  - This brief presents a programmable-gain analog readout circuit with a noise-reduction input buffer for single-ended micro-electro-mechanical-system (MEMS) microphone sensors, aiming at applications requiring low cost and high SNR. An internal feedback path is adopted in the source-follower-based input buffer to suppress the noise contribution from its bias circuit, while improve the linearity and power supply rejection ratio (PSRR). In addition, another feedback path taking advantage of the readout circuit’s high-voltage bias output for the MEMS sensor is employed to realize an effective gain of larger than unity for the input buffer, which can suppress the noise contribution of the programmable capacitive-feedback preamplifier. Fabricated in a 0.18- $\mu \text{m}$  CMOS technology, the proposed readout circuit achieves a 3.7- $\mu $ Vrms (A-weighted) input-referred noise. After packaged with a commercial MEMS microphone sensor, the overall system achieves an A-weighted SNR of 66 dBA, an acoustic overload point (AOP) of 119.5 dB sound pressure level (SPL) and a PSRR of 68 dB@1kHz. The readout chip consumes 115  $\mu \text{A}$  under a 2-V power supply and occupies an active area of 0.25mm2.

AB  - Radio frequency (RF) fingerprinting as an important non-password authentication technology has received extensive attention in recent years. It can be used as an underlying intrusion detection component for various wireless networks to enhance their wireless security further. In order to achieve more robust RF fingerprinting with deep learning, this paper develops a practical signal data augmentation solution consisting of two steps: 1) construction of sampling points 2) smooth filtering, which enables to enhance discriminability for individual radio examples. The underlying idea is that using a relatively long signal can implicitly perform noise reduction in a statistical sense since noise is often uncorrelated or partially correlated. As more sampling points accumulated, RF fingerprints could be more discernible. Experimental results have demonstrated that our proposed data augmentation can significantly improve recognition accuracy, especially in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and small example conditions.

AB  - Cochlear implants (CI) are surgically implanted auditory prostheses for partially compensating severe to profound sensorineural hearing losses. Despite providing significant intelligibility levels under silent conditions, their performance is highly affected by additive noise. Time-frequency masks, such as the binary mask, the Wiener filter (WF) and their variations, have been widely employed for noise reduction. However, they were not originally designed for CI applications, which have very particular characteristics. In this work, we propose a new method for noise reduction, especially designed for CI. It is based on the minimization of the mean square error between the squared envelopes of the estimated and target speech. The theoretical derivation of the proposed time-frequency mask is presented and a closed-form for the one-coefficient optimal solution is obtained. Numerical simulations with objective criteria indicate that the proposed method results in higher intelligibility scores as compared to the time-domain implementation of the WF time-frequency mask. Psychoacoustic experiments with normal hearing volunteers and vocoded signals, as well as CI users, corroborate simulation results, showing significant increases in intelligibility, especially for SNR <; -5 dB. The proposed method may result in an intelligibility increase of up to 70%, for SNR = -25 dB, as compared to the WF. These findings were obtained considering an ideal signal-to-noise ratio estimator.
