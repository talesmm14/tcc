AB  - In this paper, the design considerations and basic equations related to thick-film screen-printed sensing devices are included. The geometry of the device and the patterns of the functional sensing film, or of the electrodes are taken into account for the determination of the operational frequency, noise voltage, quality factor and other key parameters, related to the proper work of the resistive, capacitive and surface acoustic wave based sensors. The determination of some parasitic components and possible errors is also provided. The focus is put on the most widely spread coating patterns related to this technology – meander and comb-shaped. The technology flow chart of the screen-printing technology is given and the approaches for fine-tuning the resistance at the thick-film resistive sensors are discussed. Comparison of the typically used materials for substrates, resistive, conductive, and dielectric coatings is made. Criteria for the selection of the different pastes or inks for specific applications are mentioned.

AB  - Vehicles with ferrous material composition change the distribution of uniform earth magnetic field around them. The anisotropic magneto-resistive (AMR) sensor usually has magnetic field detection range within ±10 Oe, which is suitable to detect the earth magnetic field at 0.25~0.65 Oe as a low cost solution. The AMR sensor is able to sense the vehicle induced magnetic field change and can be utilized as vehicle detection sensor. This work uses two AMR sensor nodes to measure the vehicle velocity on the road. Signal processing is applied to remove noise and to get clean signal for precise speed calculation. The vehicle speed measured by AMR sensor is validated by a high speed camera at 250 fps. The AMR sensor at low cost and low power is a promising vehicle speed sensor for traffic flow and density management in the intelligent transport system.

AB  - Nowadays, wireless sensor networks have been widely used in many monitoring applications. Due to the low quality of sensors and random effects of the environments, however, it is well known that the collected sensor data are noisy. Therefore, it is very critical to clean the sensor data before using them to answer queries or conduct data analysis. Popular data cleaning approaches, such as the moving average, cannot meet the requirements of both energy efficiency and quick response time in many sensor related applications. In this paper, we propose a hybrid sensor data cleaning approach with confidence. Specifically, we propose a smart weighted moving average (WMA) algorithm that collects confidence data from sensors and computes the weighted moving average. The rationale behind the WMA algorithm is to draw more samples for a particular value that is of great importance to the moving average, and provide higher confidence weight for this value, such that this important value can be quickly reflected in the moving average. Based on our extensive simulation results, we demonstrate that, compared to the simple moving average (SMA), our WMA approach can effectively clean data and offer quick response time.

AB  - The recent advances in sensor technologies have made these small, tiny devices much cheaper and convenient to use in many different applications, for example, the weather and environmental monitoring fields, the hospital and factory operation sites, on the traffic road and moving vehicles and so on. Data loss and corruption is inevitable in wireless sensor networks due to the wireless interference, limited sensor power and outlier from malicious electronic devices and so on. Therefore, before processing sensor data in different wireless sensor network applications, certain data cleaning steps need to be performed to ensure the data quality, such as dealing with outliers, missing sensor readings, and noisy data. In this paper, we discuss the issues need to be considered in the data cleaning steps of this integrated data cleaning model for signal processing in wireless sensor networks. We also present an integrated model for data cleaning on signal processing systems in wireless sensor network to deal with different data cleaning problems.

AB  - This paper focuses on the problem of environmental noises in human-human communication and in automatic speech recognition. To deal with this problem, the use of alternative acoustic sensors -which are attached to the talker and receive the uttered speech through skin or bones- is investigated. In the current study, throat microphones and ear bone microphones are integrated with standard microphones using several fusion methods. The results obtained show that the recognition rates in noisy environments are drastically increased when these sensors are integrated with standard microphones. Moreover, the system does not show any recognition degradations in clean environments. In fact, recognition rates also increase slightly in clean environments. Using late fusion to integrate a throat microphone, an ear bone microphone, and a standard microphone, we achieved a 44% relative improvement in recognition rate in a noisy environment and a 24% relative improvement in recognition rate in a clean environment.

AB  - Drones are widely utilized in various industries. Unfortunately, when a drone acquires sound through a microphone, which is installed itself, drone flying and wind noises appear in recorded signals. Therefore, it is necessary to reduce such drone flying and wind noises for enhancing the quality of the recorded sound signals for UAV acoustic sensor networks. In this paper, we proposes the noise reduction method using a deep convolutional denoising autoencoder for eliminating drone flying and wind noises. The deep convolutional denoising autoencoder is widely utilized to extract the target sound source in monaural audio source separation. To do this task, a training dataset is constructed by mixing drone flying and wind noises in clean speech signal. Also, we train the neural network model, which is in form of fully convolutional neural networks. From the sound signals recorded in the real outdoor environment, it is shown that the trained model can reduce the drone flying and wind noises, and only separate the target speech.

AB  - A conventional electrical capacitance tomography (ECT) sensor consists of multiple rectangular electrodes in a single plane. To generate 3-D images, some researchers use an ECT sensor with multiplane rectangular electrodes and in-line arrangement of different electrode planes and measure the capacitance between the electrode pairs not only within the same plane but also between different planes. Because those electrode pairs in different planes are far away from each other, the measured capacitance signals between them are weak and, hence, are easily affected by noise, resulting in the obvious disturbance on the measured signals and, hence, low image quality. To address those problems, the 3-D ECT sensors with different arrangements and different shapes of electrodes are studied to investigate the effect of different arrangements and different shapes of electrodes on the measured capacitance signals and the image quality. Four 3-D ECT sensors are made with different arrangements or shapes of electrodes: rectangular electrodes are in line arrangement, whereas diamond, circular, and hexagon electrodes are staggered arrangement. The performance of the four 3-D ECT sensors is compared. The results show that 3-D ECT sensors with staggered electrodes can decrease the disturbance on the measured signals and improve the image quality of static models compared with that with conventional rectangular electrodes. Among the three 3-D ECT sensors with staggered electrodes, the 3-D ECT sensor with hexagonal electrodes has superior performance to the other two 3-D ECT sensors with diamond and circular electrodes. It was used to measure moving objects and a fluidized bed.

AB  - We present work on improving the performance of automated speech recognizers by using additional visual information: (lip-/speechreading); achieving error reduction of up to 50%. This paper focuses on different methods of combining the visual and acoustic data to improve the recognition performance. We show this on an extension of an existing state-of-the-art speech recognition system, a modular MS-TDNN. We have developed adaptive combination methods at several levels of the recognition network. Additional information such as estimated signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is used in some cases. The results of the different combination methods are shown for clean speech and data with artificial noise (white, music, motor). The new combination methods adapt automatically to varying noise conditions making hand-tuned parameters unnecessary.

AB  - We present the first ultra-miniature (<;1 mm2) capacitive accelerometers built in the epitaxial polysilicon encapsulation (`epi-seal') process. Lateral (X/Y-axis) and out-of-plane (Z-axis) accelerometers were fabricated using a variant of the epi-seal process that utilizes a separate electrode defined in the encapsulation layer. Sensitivities of up to 10.2 fF/g and 0.24 fF/g were achieved for lateral and out-of-plane accelerometers respectively. Resolution down to 0.47 mg/rt-Hz is realized, approaching the theoretical Brownian limit for a combined accelerometer and off-the-shelf capacitance-measuring chip (AD7746) system. This enables singlechip integration of accelerometers, gyroscopes, pressure sensors, thermometers, and clocks all in an established commercial manufacturing process.

AB  - Signal acquisition from the wrist using wearable device is usually corrupted by noise, sometimes up to a level where the noise completely dominates the signal. In this paper, we use the acquisition of photoplethysmography (PPG) signal as an example to demonstrate our proposed algorithm implemented on a sensor array. To increase the chances of acquiring clean PPG signal, we develop a uniform linear sensor array located above the radial artery. We also develop a wearable device to integrate our sensor array and our proposed algorithm. We propose centralized state sensing (CSS), a centralized algorithm suited to our sensor array, to increase the efficiency in multi-sensor estimation. To support our proposed algorithm, we use heart rate estimation as an example and compare it with the estimation of a single sensor and the statistical mean of the estimation of multiple sensors. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposal achieve a reduction in mean absolute error of 26.8%, compared to the estimation result obtained using the average of the estimation of all sensors. Operating on a 80 MHz processor, our algorithm introduces a 8 ms overhead, making it highly suitable for wearable devices.

AB  - Generating real-time fused combinations of VNIR, SWIR and LWIR imagery enhances situational awareness, task performance, and overall image quality. However, no quantitative means to link image quality metrics with task performance exist for fused imaging, the way it does for single modality imaging. We illustrate how fused image quality is affected by multiple dimensions, including scene illumination, reflectance contrast, thermal contrast, sensor resolution, noise-limited resolution, local adaptive gain & contrast enhancement, noise cleaning, and fusion methodology. Task performance has also been assessed in two field collection campaigns, and multiple human performance tests in the lab using field data. Though image fusion clearly improves subjective image quality, a means to predict task performance improvement is still lacking

The aim of this research is to automatically compile a summary report about the performed ADLs which can be easily interpreted by caregivers. In this work the classification performance of the WASN will be evaluated in both clean and noisy conditions. Moreover, the computational complexity of the WASN and solutions to reduce the required computational costs are examined as well. The obtained classification results indicate that the computational cost can be reduced by a factor of 2.43 without a significant loss in accuracy. In addition, the WASN yields a 1.4% to 4.8% increase in classification accuracy in noisy conditions compared to single microphone solutions.

The imager, fabricated in 0.18 mum CMOS technology, provides low- noise operation by employing both the active reset (AR) technique and the active column sensor (ACS) readout method. The emission filter was fabricated using PDMS and Sudan II Blue dye mixed, spin-coated and deposited in the class 1000 clean room. The designed filter is suitable for excitation at wavelengths below 340 nm and emission at 450nm and above. Filter properties, such as thickness, transmission and efficiency of utilization with the fabricated imager are discussed. Preliminary measurements of the system using microbeads are also presented.

AB  - Gradient field localization, such as chemical and heat source location, is a complex problem, yet few designs have been proposed. Examples are locating fires, thermal leaks in insulation, explosive vapors, illegal substances, and chemical leaks. In this paper, we propose one 4 sensor stationary array to localize the direction-of-arrival (DOA) of a temperature source and model the approach on our previous biologically-inspired array processing technique. Several variants of the algorithm are shown, and with each degree of sophistication, it significantly reduces the DOA variance caused by noisy measurement conditions. Next, a clean 4/8-sensor version of the array was constructed, and it is shown that sensor cooperation improves the adaptation in diffusive, turbulent, and noisy environments.

AB  - Source camera linking, i.e., establishing whether or not the images of interest are taken by the same camera without the camera and its digital fingerprint in the investigator's possession, is an important aspect of image forensics. Sensor pattern noises (SPNs), extracted from digital images as device fingerprints, have been proved as an effective way for digital device identification and have been used for device linking as well. However, as we demonstrate in this work, the limitation of the current method of extracting the sensor pattern noise is that the SPNs extracted from images can be severely contaminated by the details from scenes. This makes device linking a more challenging problem than source device identification because the absence of the camera prohibits the acquisition of a clean fingerprint of the camera. In this work we propose a novel approach for attenuating the influence of the details from the scenes on sensor pattern noises so as to improve the correct rate of device linking. The hypothesis underlying our SPN enhancement method is that the stronger a signal component in a SPN is, the less trustworthy the component should be and thus should be attenuated. This hypothesis suggests that an enhanced SPN can be obtained by assigning weighting factors inversely proportional to the magnitude of the SPN components.

AB  - Staircase waveforms of metal oxide sensor response modulated heater temperature were analysed and the alternative transient signal processing was proposed to improve the selectivity and sensitivity of gas sensor in order to identify various types of volatile organic compounds. Twenty-one steps of ramping voltage up and down were applied to the sensor heater and the step responses were investigated by wavelet transform for both the step levels and decay characteristics in each step. For the step decay signal analysis, Haar and the fourth order daubechies wavelets were used to decompose and analyze the signal into the seventh level resolution. The approximate coefficients at the seventh level can be used to represent the step level response. The unequal transient response during heating up and cooling down processes of each sensor for different vapours can be determined by the difference between approximate coefficient and its next step value. The detail coefficients of the level less than the fourth level were neglected to clean out unimportant detail and noise. The detail coefficients at the fourth level were employed to illustrate the unique decay feature at each step response. The wavelet coefficients containing major transient characteristic of each vapour can be selected and used as input parameters for identifying species of odour by principal component analysis without problem of voltage offset shifting.

AB  - Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), despite being energy-efficient when implemented on neuromorphic hardware and coupled with event-based Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVS), are vulnerable to security threats, such as adversarial attacks, i.e., small perturbations added to the input for inducing a misclassification. Toward this, we propose DVS-Attacks, a set of stealthy yet efficient adversarial attack methodologies targeted to perturb the event sequences that compose the input of the SNNs. First, we show that noise filters for DVS can be used as defense mechanisms against adversarial attacks. Afterwards, we implement several attacks and test them in the presence of two types of noise filters for DVS cameras. The experimental results show that the filters can only partially defend the SNNs against our proposed DVS-Attacks. Using the best settings for the noise filters, our proposed Mask Filter-Aware Dash Attack reduces the accuracy by more than 20% on the DVS-Gesture dataset and by more than 65% on the MNIST dataset, compared to the original clean frames. The source code of all the proposed DVS-Attacks and noise filters is released at https://github.com/albertomarchisio/DVS-Attacks.

AB  - A floating raft structure sensor using piezoelectric polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) film as sensitive material for grain loss detecting of combine harvester was presented in this paper. Double-layer vibration isolator was proposed to eliminate the vibration influence of combine harvester. Signal processing circuit which composed of a charge amplifier, band-pass filter, envelope detector, absolute value amplifier and square wave generator was constructed to detect the grain impact signal. According to the impact duration of grain on PVDF film, critical frequencies of band-pass filter were determined and the impact responses of filter under different impact durations were numerical simulated. Then, grain detecting experiments were carried out by assembling the sensor on the rear of vibrating cleaning sieve, the results showed that the grain impact can be identified effectively from vibrating noise and the sensor can output a standard square voltage signal while a grain impact is detected.

AB  - As the number of high-rise buildings is increasing, more methods of exterior-wall cleaning are being developed. There are a few models based on artificial intelligence that determine the type and level of contamination primarily by moving the cleaning area. In this study, we propose an system using YOLOv3 algorithm, color-detection, to install on façade cleaning robot and brightness-discrimination. There are three types of contaminant-detection parameters: size, color, and brightness, and these parameters are subjected to a robust optimization process to maintain a constant detection rate under different conditions. The three parameters are determined via Taguchi method with signal to noise ratio and noise factors. An environment for algorithm testing is established, and artificial contamination is implemented on the specimen. A field test with the detection algorithm shall be performed in the near future.

The proposed approach is based on the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and a vector of Hurst exponent coefficients. The scheme is investigated considering real acoustic noisy signals with different non-stationarity degree and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The results demonstrate that the EMD-based noise detector enables a better separation between the clean and noisy signals when compared to the competing methods. It also leads to an average SNR improvement of 4.4 dB for the resulting enhanced signals.

A distributed adaptive estimation algorithm for a fully-connected WSN is then proposed demonstrating that this MWF can be obtained by letting the nodes work on compressed (i.e. reduced-dimensional) sensor signals compared to the centralized approach. The algorithm can be used in applications such as speech enhancement in an acoustic sensor network, where (some of) the nodes nodes have prior knowledge on the location of the desired speech source and on their local microphone array geometry or have access to clean noise reference signals.

AB  - Floor cleaning robot has gained popularity in the European country. When people are busy with their work, the robot is to take over house cleaning task. Most of the service robot technologies become more and more matured so that applications far beyond fetch and carry tasks will be possible in near future. Most of the robot perform one task at the time. To be of any use, cleaning robots should be able to monitor the outcome of their work, or the need to remove dirt at the beginning for point-wise cleaning. This paper presents an approach towards the detection of various dirt on textured surfaces using a Camera image. The algorithm aims at removing the regular part of the image with spectral residual filtering leaving only the dirt and some noise and introduced a novel method to identify mud on the floor. With further post-processing, it is possible to localize many kinds of dirt in the image.

AB  - Accurate DOA estimation based on clustering the inter-sensor data ratios (ISDRs) of a single acoustic vector sensor (AVS), referred as AVS-ISDR, relies on reliable extraction of time-frequency points with high local signal-to-noise ratio (HLSNR-TFPs) and its performance degrades in noisy environments. This paper investigates deep neural networks (DNNs) trained with noisy-clean speech pairs under different SNR levels and noise types to improve the performance of AVS-ISDR in noise conditions. The DNNs is trained to learn characteristics reflecting the level of speech information at different TFPs, which helps to generate a reliable spectral mask for obtaining a noise-reduced spectral. Correspondingly, a robust DOA estimation algorithm named as AVS-DNN-ISDR has been developed. Experimental results verify the proposed DNN-based spectral mask improves the reliable HLSNR-TFPs extraction at different SNR levels. Results from simulations and real AVS recordings further validate AVS-DNN-ISDR achieving high DOA estimation accuracy even when the SNR is lower than 0dB.

AB  - In recent years, data from various auxiliary acoustic and nonacoustic sensors have been used for enhancing noisy speech. These include bone-conduction microphones, surface electromyographic sensors, ultrasonic imaging of facial movements, etc. The signal from such sensors is correlated with the speech signal to varying degrees, and unlike microphone data, is typically not affected by acoustic background noise, making its use attractive for speech enhancement. In this paper, we discuss the measurement of the utility of such data from an information-theoretic perspective, and quantify the information that is shared between clean speech and the auxiliary signal, which is not present in the observed noisy speech signal. The measure is applied to simultaneously recorded air-and bone-conducted speech data.

Fabrication technique based on SOI (silicon on insulator) wafer was developed for making ultrathin single-crystalline structures down to 20 nm thick. Mechanical quality factor (Q-factor) of the cantilever decreases with decreasing thickness due to the energy dissipation on the surface; however heating in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) cleans the surface at the atomic scale, resulting in dramatic increase of the Q-factor. All measurements were performed in an UHV chamber equipped with a laser Doppler vibrometer. Leaving the cleaned cantilever in UHV, small quantities of molecule are adsorbed on the cantilever and lower the Q-factor. These behaviors are measured on both 170 nm thick Si[100] and 50 nm thick Si[111] cantilevers. Using these ultra-thin resonators, mass change below a picogram and external force loaded on the cantilever are demonstrated.

AB  - Pipeline monitoring has been one of the issue discuss in global crisis due to the high non-revenue water reported in the global. In this paper, the usage of an erbium doped fibre laser based sensor to monitor pipeline condition, especially leakage condition by manipulating the nonlinear laser dynamics effect is reported. Vibration of the pipeline was used as an external loss modulation to trigger the chaotic condition of the fibre sensor to induce power changes on the optical sensor. The output of the optical sensor is found to be closely related to the vibration pattern of the pipeline. Hence, by catching the abnormal vibration signal of the pipeline, the health condition of the pipeline can be predicted. The vibration signal is measured and compared with an accelerometer in time and frequency domain respectively. There are three conditions tested, including defect free pipe, near leaking point and far leaking point measurement. The experiment shows the unique responses of the sensor and analysis of signal-to-noise ratio in frequency diagram was performed. From the results, the proposed sensor offer an alternative choice from conventional accelerometer which shows a cleaner result with simpler interpretation for classifying the pipeline condition.

AB  - Wearable sensors enable the simultaneous recording of several electrophysiological signals from the human body in a non-invasive and continuous manner. Textile sensors are garnering substantial interest in the wearable technology because they can be knitted directly into the daily-used objects like underwear, bra, dress, etc. However, accurate processing of signals recorded by textile sensors is extremely challenging due to the very low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Systematic classification of textile sensor noise (TSN) is necessary to: (i) identify different types of noise and their statistical characteristics, (ii) explore how each type of noise influences the electrophysiological signal, (iii) develop optimal textile-specific electronics that suppress TSN, and (iv) reproduce TSN and create large dataset of textile sensors to validate various machine learning and signal processing algorithms. In this paper, we develop a novel technique to classify textile sensor artifacts in ECG signals. By simultaneously recording signals from the waist (textile sensors) and chest (gel electrode), we extract TSN by removing the chest ECG signal from the recorded textile data. We classify TSN based on its morphological and statistical features in two main categories, namely, slow and fast. Linear prediction coding (LPC) is utilized to model each class of TSN by auto-regression coefficients and residues. The residual signal can be approximated by Gaussian distribution which enables reproducing slow and fast artifacts that not only preserve the similar morphological features but also fulfill the statistical properties of TSN. By reproducing TSN and adding them to clean ECG signals, we create a textile-like ECG signal which can be used to develop and validate different signal processing algorithms.

AB  - In the past two decades, wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and their applications have been the topic of many studies. Different multi-sensor nodes are used to collect, process and distribute data over wireless links to perform different tasks such as smart detection, target tracking, node localization, etc. In this article, the problem of distributed adaptive estimation of node-specific signals for signal enhancement or noise reduction is addressed. First the centralized rank R generalized eigenvalue decomposition (GEVD) based multichannel Wiener filter (MWF) with prior knowledge for node-specific signal estimation in a WSN is introduced, where (some of) the nodes have partial prior knowledge of the desired sources steering matrix. A distributed adaptive estimation algorithm for a fully-connected WSN is then proposed demonstrating that this MWF can be obtained by letting the nodes work on compressed (i.e. reduced-dimensional) sensor signals compared to the centralized algorithm. The distributed algorithm can be used in applications such as speech enhancement in a wireless acoustic sensor network (WASN), where (some of) the nodes have prior knowledge on the location of the desired speech sources and on their local microphone array geometry or have access to clean noise reference signals. Foundations for a proof of convergence using a Lagrangian framework, are given, since convergence is observed in batch-mode simulations. Finally, numerical simulation results are provided for a speech enhancement scenario.

AB  - With energy scarcity and environmental pollution becoming increasingly serious, the accurate estimation of fuel consumption of vehicles has been important in vehicle management and transportation planning toward a sustainable green transition. Fuel consumption is calculated by fuel-level data collected from high-precision fuel-level sensors. However, in the vehicle monitor platform, there are many types of error in the data collection and transmission processes, such as the noise, interference, and collision errors that are common in the high speed and dynamic vehicle environment. In this paper, an effective method for cleaning and repairing the fuel-level data is proposed, which adopts the threshold to acquire abnormal fuel data, the time quantum to identify abnormal data, and linear interpolation based algorithm to correct data errors. Specifically, a modified Gaussian mixture model (GMM) based on the synchronous iteration method is proposed to acquire the thresholds, which uses the particle swarm optimization algorithm and the steepest descent algorithm to optimize the parameters of GMM. The experiment results based on the fuel-level data of vehicles collected over one month prove that the modified GMM is superior to GMM-expectation maximization on fuel-level data, and the proposed method is effective for cleaning and repairing outliers of fuel-level data.

AB  - We developed a data evaluation technique that allows us to evaluate dynamically a kind of reliability of data from sensors by analytic redundancy among process variables. In this paper, we extend the data evaluation, combined with data reconciliation technique to handle the situation when both measurement error and gross error may exist. When gross error exists, data evaluation is used to filter out inadequate constraints used in data reconciliation. On the other hand, when measurement error exists, data reconciliation is used to filter out noise and hence provides data evaluation with clean relation among data. It is demonstrated by simulations that the combined method enhances diagnostic performance compared to that when both methods are applied independently.

AB  - This work examines the use of a Wireless Acoustic Sensor Network (WASN) for the classification of clinically relevant activities of daily living (ADL) of elderly people. The aim of this research is to automatically compile a summary report about the performed ADLs which can be easily interpreted by caregivers. In this work, the classification performance of the WASN will be evaluated in both clean and noisy conditions. Results indicate that the classification performance of the WASN is 75.3±4.3% on clean acoustic data selected from the node receiving with the highest SNR. By incorporating spatial information extracted by the WASN, the classification accuracy further increases to 78.6±1.4%. In addition, the classification performance of the WASN in noisy conditions is in absolute average 8.1% to 9.0% more accurate compared to highest obtained single microphone results.

AB  - This paper presents a study on alternative speech sensor for speech processing applications. Noise robustness is one of the major considerations in speech processing systems. In presence of noise, speech signal renders unintelligible naturally and thus degrades the performance of automatic speech recognition systems. Close-talk microphone perfums well for clean speech signals. The close-talk microphone based recognition performance fails under real non-stationary conditions and also degraded strongly by the background noise. One way of improving such a system performance is by the use of alternative sensors, which are attached to the speaker's skin and receive the uttered speech through throat or bones. There are two types of sensors namely alternative acoustic and non-acoustic sensors. First, alternative acoustic sensors are more isolated from environmental noise and pick up the speech signal in a robust manner. Second is to develop noisy robust speech recognition system using Multi-sensor approach. This approach combines the information from different sources of acoustic speech sensors. The thirdinvolves non-acoustic speech sensors, which are primarily used for speaker identification task and some speech recognition applications. Fourth, discusses the speech enhancement methods for the noisy speech signal. These approaches help to improve the speech recognition system in noisy conditions and lead to building a robust ASR system.

AB  - Large cities are paying a lot of attention to the dramatic challenges resulted from increasing air pollution and the global warming, struggling to find new promising solutions to face them. As a result, alternative transportation in urban areas has been sought, trying to reduce urban pollution while also addressing mobility issues in crowded cities. Actually, although bikes have been considered as a promising resource for more efficient and cleaner urban mobility, there are several concerns that must be considered when using bike paths already implemented in urban areas. In fact, some environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, noise pollution, ultraviolet radiation and light intensity can bring several problems to the health of cyclists who are constantly exposed to them, thus requiring constant and historical analysis of these conditions. In this context, this paper proposes an environmental monitoring system based on low-cost mobile sensors-based devices attached to bikes, which allow the identification of the most recommended areas for cycling in relation to possible damage to the health of cyclists. For that, the electronic components chosen for the construction of those devices must be highly accessible and affordable, supporting large-scale development. Additionally, the proposed approach is based on a hybrid communication model that does not require any urban communication infrastructure, easing its practical exploitation. The proposed approach seeks then to provide better support to governments when assessing the conditions of the currently installed bike paths and also when planning the implementation of new paths, potentially bringing important contributions to the management of modern cities.

AB  - Wearable electrocardiogram (ECG) sensors technology has great significance today since it can continuously monitor people's health conditions. In this work, we set out to design a high-quality amplifier circuit that can be used for wearable ECG sensors technology. This amplifier was constructed by a three-stage circuit, which included a human body model, input, and amplifier circuit, and connect the circuit. The proposed circuit used two operational transconductance amplifiers, which can lower power supply and power consumption. LTspice environment was utilized to simulate the circuit and analyze the result. The simulation presented that the common mode rejection ratio of this work was about 86.73dB. The input-referred noise was about $6.4 \mu\text{Vrms}$, and the noise was about $2.89 \mu\mathrm{W}$ for each operational transconductance amplifier. The result demonstrated that the amplifier was of good quality, having the potential to be adopted into wearable ECG sensors technology for its capability to extract and amplify clean electrocardiogram signals.

This facilitates the experts to provide guidance from the places they are currently available to where it is required immediately. Portable device is designed using CC2540 network processor supported by wireless sensors for recording ECG, EMG and EEG. The key advantages of this processor are low power requirement, built-in Bluetooth and cost effective. OMAP 3530 is an embedded processor used to design the portable terminal supported by USB based Bluetooth device and a display. This portable terminal is efficient, energy saving and is very useful for wireless monitoring applications. Noise cancellation of acquired signals is done before transmitting them to remote areas using morphological filtering. Clean signal that is obtained enable the medical experts to provide exact guidance. The filtered signals are stored in a database at local areas and then transmitted to remote areas through network support provided by Wi-Fi or 3G technology.

AB  - Usefulness of one-class support vector machine (SVM) is demonstrated for detection of outliers in surface acoustic wave (SAW) sensor array data for odor recognition. The one-class SVM for outlier detection is essentially a two-class pattern recognition formulation wherein outliers are considered to be the only target class, and the rest data points are grouped to make a normal class. The construction of decision function needs training with known class identities. In test phase, the algorithm picks up those data points as outlier which do not classify as normal. The SAW sensor array is an important platform for making electronic noses that fulfill varied needs of specific applications. The outliers in SAW electronic noses may occur due to electronic instabilities, fluidic fluctuations, electromagnetic interference, temperature fluctuation, or presence of non targeted chemicals. Therefore, it is important to clean up data for outliers for achieving high performance SAW odor recognition system. Even though one-class SVM has been used in other applications such as image processing and text recognition, here we analyze its suitability for sensor array based electronic nose data. A simulated SAW sensor array dataset comprised of 11 sensors and 6 vapor classes laden with varied levels of noise and outliers is considered. It is shown that the one-class SVM is quite efficient for detection of outliers in electronic nose data.

AB  - The emergence of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) to enhance manufacturing and industrial processes allows data analysts to address significant problems such as predictive maintenance. For the purpose of accurate data analysis, cleansing noisy sensor data is one of the most fundamental and necessary steps. Without first removing the noise, the anomaly detection techniques are likely to give a large number of false positives. However, using traditional outlier detection methods directly for such analysis are not appropriate as both noise and significant anomalies might exist in the sensor data. This article introduces the new challenges and proposes a novel solution to address the issue of removing noise while preserving anomalies in the IIoT Data. It proposes an approach that measures both the rate of change and deviation to compute the noise score. It employs a sliding window technique to define the analysis unit of the contrast measure which is used in conjunction with statistical techniques. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the other state-of-the-art noise detection methods, providing a clean data set that preserves the anomalies on which one can effectively apply anomaly detection techniques.

AB  - This paper presents the design of a compliant manipulator using a series elastic actuator (SEA) and a mechanism for precisely measuring the force acting on the contact part of the manipulator without using a force sensor. It is important to maintain a constant contact force between the compliant manipulator and the wall in order to guarantee cleaning performance, and the ball screw mechanism is used to adapt to changes in the distance and the angle. Position-based impedance control is used to maintain a constant contact force when the manipulator interacts with the wall of the building, and the results confirm that the system stability is guaranteed when using SEA, regardless of the variation in the actual stiffness of the manipulator. The results of extensive experimentation using the test bench demonstrate the force tracking performance against various types of wall changes using the stiff wet-type cleaning manipulator. The results indicate that the stiffness of SEA affects the force tracking performance and system stability under the condition of the manipulator and environment interaction, and that the system stability and control performance can be improved by applying a robust force measurement mechanism to noise.

AB  - This paper describes the development and implementation of a combined metal and magnetic sensor suite for the detection of meteorites from a mobile robot. The relative disposition of the sensors and the overall configuration of the sensor suite with respect to the rover are such that clean measurements are achieved and interference is minimized. We validated the combined electromagnetic sensors in laboratory and field tests on a variety of stony and iron meteorites. Experiments show that both sensing modalities (eddy current and magnetic) are necessary to achieve comprehensive readings from meteorites. The sensors have detected meteorites smaller than 2 cm in size. The sensor suite is configured to allow in-situ, autonomous calibration of the sensors and to mitigate noise from the electrical components of the robot that deploys them.

AB  - Emerging Internet of Things (IoT)-based environmental sensing projects provide large-scale sensing data from individual sensors with high reading frequencies. These readings are usually produced by commodity sensors with varied reliabilities, and inevitably contain noises and errors. Most existing data cleaning techniques focus on issues such as communication overhead reduction and energy preservation, and do not take advantage of the unaggregated data from individual sensors that IoT environmental sensing projects offer. In this paper, we propose an Expectation Maximization algorithm for finding reliable sensors in environmental sensing data that assumes the preservation of individual sensor readings and high reading frequencies. Our approach simultaneously finds the environmental feature model and the faulty state of the sensors. Our extensive experiments show that the proposed approach is significantly more effective than existing approaches. Particularly, in a case where reliable sensors and faulty sensors differ significantly in their readings, the maximum squared error for other approaches exceeds 200, but for our approach is only 1.23.

AB  - In this work an improved current sensor is proposed. The current sensor uses an advanced calibration algorithm and aims to achieve better than 1% accuracy. Hall effect based current sensors measure the magnetic field originating from the current. Hall element converts the field to a voltage using Hall effect. The nonlinearity of magnetic permeability in ferromagnetic core brings about nonlinearity during magnetic field generation and causes hysteresis. Thus, the accuracy of the Hall effect current sensor decreases. To prevent drop in accuracy, hysteresis characteristic of the sensor can be calibrated. The inputs are filtered to clean up noise. Creating a set of calibration polynomials, these functions can be used to improve sensor outputs. The algorithm can improve the sensor error performance from 1% in gain calibrated sensors to 0.3% for min RMS measurement error based calibration.

AB  - With the rapid growth in the use of various smart digital sensors, the Internet of Things (IoT) is a swiftly growing technology, which has contributed significantly to Industry 4.0 and the promotion of IoT-based smart factories, which gives rise to the new challenges of big data analytics and the implementation of machine learning techniques. This article proposes a practical framework that combines IoT techniques, a data lake, data analysis, and cloud computing for manufacturing equipment health-state monitoring and diagnostics in smart manufacturing. It addresses all the required aspects in the realization of such a system and allows the seamless interchange of data and functionality. Due to the specific characteristics of IoT sensor data (low quality, redundant multisources, partial labeling), we not only provide a promising framework but also give detailed insights and pay considerable attention to data quality issues. In the proposed framework, an ingestion procedure is designed to manage data collection, data security, data transformation and data storage issues. To improve the quality of IoT big data, a high-noise feature filter is proposed for automated preliminary sensor selection to suppress noisy features, followed by a noisy data cleaning module to provide good quality data for unbiased diagnosis modeling. The proposed framework can achieve seamless integration between IoT big data ingestion from the physical factory and machine learning-based data analytics in the virtual systems. It is built on top of the Apache Spark processing engine, being capable of working in both big data and real-time environments. One case study has been conducted based on a four-stage syngas compressor from real industries, which won the Best Industry Application of IoT at the BigInsights Data &#x0026; AI Innovation Awards. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of both the proposed IoT-architecture and techniques to address the data quality issues.

AB  - In this paper, a fully functional low light 128 X 128 contact image sensor for cell detection in biosensing applications is presented. The imager, fabricated in 0.18 mum CMOS technology, provides low-noise operation by employing both a modified version of the active reset (AR) technique and a modified version of the active column sensor (ACS) readout method. High-sensitivity, low noise performance of the presented sensor is well-suited for fluorescence imaging. For this purpose, an emission filter was fabricated and integrated with the sensor. The filter was fabricated using PDMS and Sudan II Blue dye mix, spin-coated and deposited in a class 1000 clean room. The designed filter is suitable for excitation at wavelengths below 340 nm and emission at 450 nm and above. The fabricated imager architecture and operation are described, noise analysis is presented and measurements from a test chip are shown. Experimental results using live neurons from the pond snail, Lymnaea stagnalis, and fluorescence polystyrene micro-beads prove the functionality of the fabricated system and indicate its biocompatiblity.

AB  - In this paper, we demonstrate a perceptual-based 3D skeleton motion data refinement method based on a bidirectional recurrent autoencoder, called BRA-P. Three main technical contributions are made by the proposed network. First, the proposed BRA-P can address noisy data with different noise types and amplitudes using one network, and this attribute makes the approach more suitable for raw motion data with heterogeneous mixed noise. Second, due to the usage of perceptual loss, which measures the difference in high-level features extracted by a pretrained perceptual autoencoder, BRA-P improves the perceptual similarity between refined motion data and clean motion data, especially for the case where the noisy data and target clean data have different topologies. Third, BRA-P further improves the bone-length consistency and smoothness of the refined motion using the perceptual autoencoder as a postprocessing network. Ablation experiments verify the effect of the three technical contributions of our approach. The results of the experiments on synthetic noise data and raw motion data captured by Kinect demonstrate that our method outperforms several state-of-the-art methods in the cleaning of mixed-noise data by one network.

AB  - The problem of noise reduction has attracted a considerable amount of research attention over the past several decades. Among the numerous techniques that were developed, the optimal Wiener filter can be considered as one of the most fundamental noise reduction approaches, which has been delineated in different forms and adopted in various applications. Although it is not a secret that the Wiener filter may cause some detrimental effects to the speech signal (appreciable or even significant degradation in quality or intelligibility), few efforts have been reported to show the inherent relationship between noise reduction and speech distortion. By defining a speech-distortion index to measure the degree to which the speech signal is deformed and two noise-reduction factors to quantify the amount of noise being attenuated, this paper studies the quantitative performance behavior of the Wiener filter in the context of noise reduction. We show that in the single-channel case the a posteriori signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) (defined after the Wiener filter) is greater than or equal to the a priori SNR (defined before the Wiener filter), indicating that the Wiener filter is always able to achieve noise reduction. However, the amount of noise reduction is in general proportional to the amount of speech degradation. This may seem discouraging as we always expect an algorithm to have maximal noise reduction without much speech distortion. Fortunately, we show that speech distortion can be better managed in three different ways. If we have some a priori knowledge (such as the linear prediction coefficients) of the clean speech signal, this a priori knowledge can be exploited to achieve noise reduction while maintaining a low level of speech distortion. When no a priori knowledge is available, we can still achieve a better control of noise reduction and speech distortion by properly manipulating the Wiener filter, resulting in a suboptimal Wiener filter. In case that we have multiple microphone sensors, the multiple observations of the speech signal can be used to reduce noise with less or even no speech distortion.

AB  - The pulse oximeters are used to measure the heart rate and arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2). The photoplethysmographic (PPG) signals from pulse oximeters are highly influenced by the noise generated due to movement. The signal is also affected by the ambience light signal. It is essential to obtain a clean signal for the measurement of arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2). In this paper, an Adaptive Noise Cancelling (ANC) technique is being used to remove noise from the signal. A tri-axial based accelerometer data is also taken during the data acquisition time. Normalized Least Mean Square (NLMS) based adaptive filter algorithm is adopted. Tri-axis accelerometer data gives the directional data along the entire three axes. They are summed up and they are fed into the adaptive filter as reference noise signal. In the filter, the coefficients are updated based on the error signal and they are updated till the error becomes minimum. From the obtained clean signal oxygen saturation is calculated by finding the normalized ratio of ratios. Accelerometer based adaptive noise cancellation is found to reduce the errors in arterial oxygen saturation. The mean result for the mentioned algorithm is around 0.2409. The result is also found to be in correlation with the reference pulse oximeter.

AB  - In this paper, we propose a Bayesian minimum mean squared error approach for the joint estimation of the short-term predictor parameters of speech and noise, from the noisy observation. We use trained codebooks of speech and noise linear predictive coefficients to model the a priori information required by the Bayesian scheme. In contrast to current Bayesian estimation approaches that consider the excitation variances as part of the a priori information, in the proposed method they are computed online for each short-time segment, based on the observation at hand. Consequently, the method performs well in nonstationary noise conditions. The resulting estimates of the speech and noise spectra can be used in a Wiener filter or any state-of-the-art speech enhancement system. We develop both memoryless (using information from the current frame alone) and memory-based (using information from the current and previous frames) estimators. Estimation of functions of the short-term predictor parameters is also addressed, in particular one that leads to the minimum mean squared error estimate of the clean speech signal. Experiments indicate that the scheme proposed in this paper performs significantly better than competing methods

AB  - Respiratory sounds contain crucial information concerning the physiologies and pathologies of pulmonary system. Computerized respiratory sound analysis can provide an objective evaluation of the respiratory function. Usually, the real environments of respiratory sound measurement are noisy. The less clarity of respiratory sounds could cause the utilization of computerized respiratory sound analysis technology in normal circumstances unfeasible. The objective of this paper was to evaluate the performance of least mean square (LMS) adaptive filter, the dual sensor spectral subtraction algorithm (DSSS), and independent component analysis (ICA) in eliminating the environmental noises from respiratory sounds. The performance analysis of these three methods was quantified by relative error of power spectral density between the clean lung sound and the denoised lung sound. Our experimental results indicate that the DSSS algorithm has a relatively better performance in removing the environmental noises at low SNR levels (5 dB and 10dB).

AB  - Dynamic defects on floor of large Aboveground Storage Tanks (AST) may lead to serious tank accidents and loss of properties. Acoustic emission (AE) has been used in storage tank floor inspection to rank maintenance priority in recent years before using other non-destructive methods, such as magnetic flux leakage, eddy current and ultrasonic. There are both economical and environmental benefits by not emptying and cleaning large storage tanks. This paper mainly covers principle of corrosion condition inspection for storage tank floor using AE method and investigation on AE sensors used in the test. Frequency, number, and installation requirements including height, space, and coupling agent are investigated in detail. Nielsen-Hsu pencil break calibration process for AE inspection channel is introduced. In the end, an AE inspection was carried out on a 20000m3 AST containing crude oil. Optimized BP Neural network is used in pattern recognition to remove electro-magnetic noise and mechanical fiction noise.

AB  - With the increasing clock speed and complexity of SoCs, measuring clock jitter becomes challenging. To effectively manage the tight jitter performance required by an SoC, the clock quality should be directly evaluated at every point where the clock is used in the SoC. In previous work [1-3], on-chip clock measurements were carried out, but these circuits are difficult to integrate into varied systems due to their special requirements of low-noise analog circuitry, a clean reference clock and additional calibration. We propose a fully synthesizable period jitter sensor (PJS), requiring no analog circuit, reference or calibration by improving upon a stochastic time-to-digital converter (TDC) [4]. The inverter delay chain of the stochastic TDC in [4] has a weakness: it may lose delayed signals due to its lengthy delay chain. It is replaced with a short-pulse delay chain, which does not lose delayed signals under any process, voltage and temperature (PVT) conditions. In addition, the proposed PJS is specified in RTL code and is fully synthesizable. It achieves 0.5pspp resolution for real-time period jitter measurements when its input clock frequency is 1GHz.

AB  - Assessing the quality of sensor data in environmental monitoring applications is important, as erroneous readings produced by malfunctioning sensors, calibration drift, and problematic climatic conditions such as icing or dust, are common. Traditional data quality checking and correction is a painstaking manual process, so the development of automatic systems for this task is highly desirable. This study investigates machine learning methods to identify and clean incorrect data from a real-world environmental sensor network, the Jornada Experimental Range, located in Southern New Mexico. We analyze several learning algorithms and data replacement schemes and conclude that learning algorithms are an effective way of cleansing this type of datasets.

AB  - Water quality monitoring is a critical part of environmental management and protection. The detection of contamination and impurity levels in water is of importance for the protection of public health. In this paper, we present a novel method for detection of impurities in water based on measuring the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the surface acoustic wave (SAW) device. An aluminum nitride (AIN) based SAW device is fabricated for residues detection. NaCl and SiO2 are regarded as water-soluble and water-insoluble impurities in water respectively. The experimental results show that the SAW propagation surfaces are cleaner after evaporation of different kinds of water samples, which then result in higher SNRs. Nevertheless, for different mass concentrations of NaCl and SiO2 droplets, the SNRs of the SAW device are lower due to more residues left on the wave propagation path after evaporation.

AB  - A noise-robust classification method is proposed to discriminate the moving vehicle and walking human via the time-frequency feature extracted from the micro-Doppler signature of low resolution radar. Since the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) directly relates to the distance between the target and radar for a given noise power and radar power, the denoising preprocessing is usually required to increase the classification distance between the target and radar in the real application. In this paper, we extend the real-valued probabilistic principal component analysis model to the complex-value domain, and develop the complex probabilistic principal component analysis (CPPCA) model for the complex-valued echoes from the ground moving targets. Then, the denoising preprocessing is accomplished based on signal reconstruction with CPPCA model, where we utilize the Bayesian inference criterion (BIC) to adaptively select the principal components. Compared with the existing CLEAN-based noise reduction method, the CPPCA-BIC-based method can work without SNR prior information. After denoising, a 3-D time-frequency feature vector is extracted from the denoised micro-Doppler signatures of the two kinds of ground targets, and the classification is performed via support vector machine classifier. In the experiments based on the measured data, the proposed classification scheme shows good classification and denoising performances under the relatively low SNR condition. The proposed method can also be applied to other classification problems based on micro-Doppler effect.

AB  - We present a method to combine the standard and throat microphone signals for robust speech recognition in noisy environments. Our approach is to use the probabilistic optimum filter (POF) mapping algorithm to estimate the standard microphone clean-speech feature vectors, used by standard speech recognizers, from both microphones' noisy-speech feature vectors. A small untranscribed "stereo" database (noisy and clean simultaneous recordings) is required to train the POF mappings. In continuous-speech recognition experiments using SRI International's DECIPHER recognition system, both using artificially added noise and using recorded noisy speech, the combined-microphone approach significantly outperforms the single-microphone approach.

AB  - In a previous work, a novel technique for angle of arrival (AOA) measurement was proposed. This technique consists of sweeping the angular domain with one antenna, step by step, such that at each measurement step the received signal voltage at the rotating antenna (sensor) is measured. The signal voltage vector is the convolution between the antenna electric field pattern and the AOAs (magnitude and phase) of the incident wave. In this letter, a denoising CLEAN algorithm is modified and applied to this technique in order to eliminate spurious peaks and accurately find the AOAs of incoming waves. A set of measurements is made to evaluate the proposed algorithm. The results show the effectiveness of the denoising algorithm in reducing the noise level; a high angular precision in measured AOAs is noticed.

AB  - Convolutional neural networks have been the focus of research aiming to solve image denoising problems, but their performance remains unsatisfactory for most applications. These networks are trained with synthetic noise distributions that do not accurately reflect the noise captured by image sensors. Some datasets of clean-noisy image pairs have been introduced but they are usually meant for benchmarking or specific applications. We introduce a dataset [NIND] of DSLR-like images with varying levels of ISO noise which is large enough to train models for blind denoising over a wide range of noise. We demonstrate a denoising model trained with the NIND and show that it significantly outperforms BM3D on ISO noise from unseen images, even when generalizing to images from a different type of camera. The Natural Image Noise Dataset is published on Wikimedia Commons such that it remains open for curation and contributions. We expect that this dataset will prove useful for future image denoising applications.

AB  - This paper proposes a reduced-rank minimum description length (MDL) method to enumerate the incident waves impinging on a uniform linear array (ULA). First, a new observation data and a reference signal are formed from sensor data by means of the shift-invariance property of the ULA. A cross-correlation between them is calculated, which is able to capture signal information and efficiently suppress additive noise. Second, the normalized cross-correlation is used as initial information for a recursion procedure to quickly partition the observation data into two orthogonal components in a signal subspace and a reduced-rank noise subspace. The components in the noise subspace are employed to calculate the total code length that is required to encode the observation data. Finally, the model with the shortest code length, namely the minimum description length, is chosen as the best model. Unlike the traditional MDL methods, this method partitions the observation data into the cleaner signal and noise subspace components by means of the recursion procedure, avoiding the estimation of a covariance matrix and its eigendecomposition. Thus, the method has the advantage of computational simplicity. Its performance is demonstrated via numerical results.

AB  - Acoustic cavitation plays a key role in several fields including therapeutic medicine and cleaning. Meanwhile, acoustic cavitation is a hazardous phenomenon due to the damage to targets irradiated by ultrasound such as normal cells in the human body. Therefore, it is important to control cavitation. An accurate technique for measuring the amount of generated cavitation with the aim of its control is required. Therefore, we have been studying a novel accurate cavitation measurement technique that uses the broadband integrated voltage (BIV) calculated from the broadband noise measured by a hollow cylindrical cavitation sensor. In this study, the distribution of BIV in the direction of ultrasound propagation and parallel to the surface of the water in a water vessel was measured using a high resolution cavitation sensor that has improved spatial resolution. The distribution of BIV values measured using the cavitation sensor was compared with the distribution of sonochemiluminescence (SCL) emissions observed from the side of the vessel. In the results, high values of BIV in the direction of ultrasound propagation measured by the cavitation sensor exhibited an interval of approximately 5 mm. This interval corresponds to the half wavelength period of the operating frequency of 150 kHz. The high values of BIV agreed well with the observed distribution of SCL emissions. This indicates that the cavitation sensor has the potential to accurately measure the nodes and antinodes of a standing wave acoustic field. The distribution of BIV values in the direction parallel to the surface of the water also agreed well with SCL. The results show that BIV measured by the cavitation sensor has the potential to become an accurate tool for measuring the spatial distribution of acoustic cavitation generation.

AB  - In this paper, a new approach to the problem of impulsive noise reduction in image is presented. First, an image neighborhood hypergraph representation using a similarity measure is computed. Next, a detection procedure based on hypergraph properties is used to classify hyperedges either as noisy, or clean data. Then we apply a nonlinear filter to noisy detected pixels. The results show that the proposed method outperforms most of the basic algorithms for the reduction of impulsive noise.

AB  - This paper presents an analyzing and modeling scheme that can dig into the ship sensor data to generate models for ship motion prediction. As the raw sensor data contains information that is noisy and discontinuous, three data cleaning methods used for noise reduction, data continuing and resampling are developed. According to specific ship applications, various ship motion constraints are designed to filter and establish meaningful data sets which will be used in the modeling step. Correlation analysis within the data sets is performed to figure out how significant the sensor data contributes to the predictive target. An flexible neural network based modeling mechanism is implemented, in which the user can design the model based on the correlation analysis. By training and testing the neural network using the generated data sets, the ship motion predictive model is obtained. Through a case study of fine maneuvering, the scheme is verified efficient in analyzing and modeling sensor data for ship motion prediction.

AB  - Heart rate (HR) monitoring using photoplethysmographic (PPG) signals recorded from wearers' wrist greatly facilitates design of wearable devices and maximizes user experience. However, placing PPG sensors in wrist causes much stronger and complicated motion artifacts (MA) due to loose interface between sensors and skin. Therefore, developing robust HR estimation algorithms for wrist-type PPG signals has significant commercial values. In this paper, we propose a robust HR estimation algorithm for wrist-type PPG signals using multiple reference adaptive noise cancellation (ANC) technique-termed here as “MURAD.” The main challenge of using ANC for MA reduction is to devise a qualified reference noise signal (RNS) to the adaptive filter. We propose a novel solution by using four RNSs, namely, the three-axis accelerometer data and the difference signal between the two PPG signals. For each RNS, we get a different version of the cleaned PPG signal. Then, a set of probable HR values is estimated using all of the cleaned PPG signals, and then, the value that is closest to the estimated HR of the previous time window is chosen to be the HR estimate of the current window. Then, some peak verification techniques are employed to ensure accurate HR estimations. The proposed technique gives lower average absolute error compared to state-of-the art methods. So, MURAD method provides a promising solution to the challenge of HR monitoring using PPG in wearable devices during severe MA conditions.

AB  - Short-term traffic flow prediction plays a key role of Intelligent Transportation System (ITS), which supports traffic planning, traffic management and control, roadway safety evaluation, energy consumption estimation, etc. The widely deployed traffic sensors provide us numerous and continuous traffic flow data, which may contain outlier samples due to expected sensor failures. The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the use of various smoothing models for cleaning anomaly in traffic flow data, which were further processed to predict short term traffic flow evolution with artificial neural network. The wavelet filter, moving average model, and Butterworth filter were carefully tested to smooth the collected loop detector data. Then, the artificial neural network was introduced to predict traffic flow at different time spans, which were quantitatively analyzed with commonly-used evaluation metrics. The findings of the study provide us efficient and accurate denoising approaches for short term traffic flow prediction.

AB  - In today’s world, Global positioning system (GPS)-based navigation is inexpensive for providing position, velocity, and time (PVT) information. GPS receivers are widely used on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and these targets are vulnerable to deliberate interference such as spoofing. In this paper, GPS spoofing detection and mitigation for UAVs are proposed using distributed radar ground stations equipped with a local tracker. In the proposed approach, UAVs and local trackers are linked to the fusion node. The UAVs estimate their position and covariance using the extended Kalman filter framework and send it to a fusion node as primary data. Simultaneously, the time-varying kinematics of the UAVs are estimated using the extended Kalman filter and global nearest neighbor association tracker frameworks, and this data is transmitted to the central fusion node as secondary data. A track-to-track association is proposed to detect spoofing attacks using available primary and secondary data. After detecting the spoofing attack, the secondary data is subjected to a correlation-free fusion. We propose using this fused state as a control input to the UAVs to mitigate the spoofing attack. The spoofing scenario results show that using the predicted fusion state provides the same accuracy as a GPS receiver in a clean environment. Furthermore, because the innovation is calculated using the predicted fused state, there is no effect on the number of satellite signals on PRMSE. Additionally, in terms of PRMSE, radars with low measurement noise outperform radars with high measurement noise. The proposed algorithm is best suited for use in drone swarm applications.

AB  - We consider the problem of detecting the presence of an improper complex-valued signal, common among two or more sensors (channels), in the presence of spatially independent, colored improper noise and additive outliers. A source of improper noise is in-phase/quadrature-phase imbalance during down-conversion of bandpass noise to baseband at the receiver. For clean data (i.e., known to be outlier free), a nonparametric binary hypothesis testing formulation in frequency-domain, utilizing the discrete Fourier transform of an augmented measurement sequence, has been proposed in the literature, and it results in a generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT). In this paper we robustify this approach against additive outliers in the data, using a data-cleaning approach. Using some existing robust estimators of multivariate scatter, we first detect the outliers, and subsequently remove and replace them using vector median filtering to yield cleaned data. The existing GLRT is then applied to the cleaned data. The approach is illustrated via simulations. The considered problem has applications in diverse areas including spectrum sensing for cognitive radio.

AB  - Accurate and sufficient design of AMS signal paths is always being a challenge for system designers requiring high simulation performance of the analog model which also incorporates circuit level non-idealities. The new SystemC AMS extensions offer high simulation performance as well as capabilities of incorporating circuit level non-ideal effects. In this paper we modelled a low Over Sampling Ratio (OSR), second order Sigma Delta (ΣΔ) Analog to Digital Converter (ADC) which incorporates non-ideal effects like sampling jitter, kBT/CS noise, switch non-linearities, band-gap noise and operational amplifier non-idealities (such as finite gain, finite bandwidth, gain nonlinearity, slew rate, leakage and saturation effect). The ADC shows a performance bottle neck of 16 bits. State-of-Art signal conditioning techniques use adaptive correction methods inside the analog part or inside the DSP part of the ADC making it more complicated to realize. In our design we have implemented the adaptive filtration within the micro-controller to correct the noise ground as well as large signal non-linear effects to produce an output which is 20-bits clean, proving sufficiency of low order and low OSR of a ΣΔ ADC for 20 bit resolution as well as a simplified adaptive filtration scheme alleviating the need of adaptive blocks within the ADC.

AB  - Deep neural networks (DNNs) have shown phenomenal success in many real-world applications. However, a concerning weakness of DNNs is their vulnerability to adversarial attacks. Although there exist some methods to detect adversarial attacks, they often suffer from high computational cost and constraints on certain types of attacks, and ignore external features that could aid during attack detection. In this article, we propose fast confidence detection method (FCDM), an innovative method for fast confidence detection of adversarial attacks based on measuring the integrity of sensor pattern noise fingerprinting embedded in input examples. We note that the existing adversarial detectors are often designed as a binary classifier to differentiate clean or adversarial examples. However, the detection of adversarial examples can be much more complicated than such a scenario. Our key insight is that the confidence level of detecting an input sample as an adversarial example is a more useful info for the system to properly take an action to resist potential attacks. The experimental results show that FCDM is capable to give a confidence distribution model of the most popular adversarial attacks. And, using the confidence distribution model, FCDM can quickly determine the confidence level of the input sample. Based on different properties of the confidence distribution models associated with these adversarial attacks, FCDM can provide early attack warning including even the possible attack types of the adversarial attack examples. FCDM also has the following advantages: 1) it is effective for both a white-box attack and black-box attack; 2) it do not depend on the class of adversarial attacks and can be used as both known attack defense and unknown attack defense; and 3) it does not need to know the details of the DNN model and does not affect the functionality of the DNN. Since fast confidence detection method (FCDM) is a computationally heavy task, we propose an FPGA-based accelerator based on a series of optimization techniques, such as the quantization, data reuse and operation replacement, etc. We implement our method on an FPGA platform and achieve a system clock frequency of 279 MHz with a power consumption of the only 0.7626 W. Moreover, in the real system performance test, we obtain a high efficiency of 29.740 IPS/W and a low latency of just 44.1 ms with very marginal accuracy loss.

AB  - Graphical user interface is addressed for outlier detection in sensor measurement. One of the essential steps toward sensor measurement analysis and decision making is anomaly detection. Specifically, measurement noise may encounter abnormal readings, which affect the model algorithm and hence misleading decisions; hence, data must be explored, cleaned, and corrected before being considered for statistical analysis. In this paper, we propose an interactive, easy to navigate, and friendly user interface to extract and explore the sensor's abnormal measurement records. Extraction, visualization, and detection are the three main tasks of such an interface, particularly providing the user with a variety of predefined detection techniques as the first step toward data analysis. The interface is operated via Matlab, and the effectiveness of such a tool is demonstrated by the mean of real-time measurements extraction where different outlier detection is considered.

AB  - Autonomous quadrocopter recently has shown a significant usages and potentials to be used widely in the commercial market. This caused the aircraft to become a well-liked subject among the researchers and research organizations. With good controllability and stability on its motions will make the usability of the quadrocopter to perform a task reliably. For this to happen, clean signals from accelerometer and gyroscope sensors appreciably play an essential role. However, the sensor's signals are routinely encounter problems with noise and drift. Hence, a filter is required to correct this imperfectness. In this paper, a simplified algorithm for Kalman's filter appropriates to be used by a low-cost microcontroller is presented. The research mainly focuses on filtering noisy outputs from the accelerometer so that the output is necessarily clean to be used for real-time quadrocopter pitch and roll angles estimation. Experimental results on assessment of the algorithm by varying the process and measurement noises are provided. The results reveal with correct tuning on the noise parameters; the filter algorithm is satisfying to give stable angles values with fine accuracy.

AB  - The purpose of this study is trying to apply VM [1][2] for measuring machining precision of machine tools. As shown in the left portion of Fig. 1, the AVM server [3] needs process data, which contain sensor data and machining parameters, as inputs for predicting machining accuracies. However, most machine tools do not possess sensors for providing raw process data such as vibration, current, etc. Furthermore, machining operations usually possess severe vibrations and loud noises. It makes the raw data collected from sensors attached to machine tools with low signal-to-noise (S/N) ratios, thereby affecting the prediction accuracy of VM. Even though the AVM has been an effective way to conduct workpiece measurements in high-tech industries [1], there exist challenges when applying the AVM to machining industry. Besides embedding essential sensors on the machine tool effectively, the challenges are 1) Segmentation: to accurately segment essential part of the raw process data from the original NC file, 2) Data Cleaning: to effectively handle raw process/sensor data with low S/N ratios, and 3) Feature Extraction: to properly extract significant features from the segmented raw process data. This work proposes a novel GED-plus-AVM (GAVM) system as depicted in Fig.1 to resolve all the challenges mentioned above. These challenges are judiciously addressed and successfully resolved in this paper.

AB  - This article aims at determining the anomalies created by buried magnetic materials on the horizontal component of earth's magnetic field through the KMZ51 anisotropic magnetoresistive sensor (AMR) series and determining the upper surface image of the material through the sensor series located in different positions per soil by processing the sensor data obtained due to anomaly at different heights from the soil surface using a feedforward artificial neural network (ANN) trained with the Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) backpropagation algorithm. In our study, in this direction, first, a mechanical scanning system ensuring the 3-D movement of the sensors, a data capture module to process the data transmitted from the KMZ51 AMR sensors and to transmit to the computer, and a magnetic measurement system composed of a computer software package to evaluate and record the data transmitted to the computer were established. Afterward, the magnetic materials with known magnetic, chemical, and geometrical properties were buried in soil containing 28.5% magnetic particles and 4.1% natural moisture with the help of the measurement system and the voltage changes in AMR sensors resulting from the anomaly were transmitted into the computer through the 2-D movement of the platform. This process was repeated for five different heights. The voltage values obtained were converted into a data matrix; then, the undesired noises in data resulting from the magnetic character of soil were cleared by filtering through the median and the base. Such cleaned data were converted into black and white images with a threshold value calculation method for conversion into black and white in grayscale histograms developed by “Otsu”; and the upper surface image of the buried material was determined. Finally, a feedforward ANN using the LM backpropagation algorithm was trained with the data measured from 0-, 1.5-, 3-, 4.5-, and 6-cm heights from the magnetic material; and the voltage values measured from 3- and 6-cm heights from the magnetic material were provided to the ANN as inputs, respectively, and thus, the voltage values for the same material at 0-cm height were found. Thereby, the upper surface image of the material could be determined by the same way as that obtained from 0-cm height even though the sensor series is at a different position compared with the soil surface through the ANN developed. Although many magnetic materials were tested, the results of a cuboid and a cylindrical material were provided within the scope of our study article and the performance of the ANN was discussed. In addition, the success of the ANN in different soil mixtures was confirmed for these two materials.

AB  - This work presents a real-time approach to the detection, isolation, and prediction of component failures in large-scale systems through the combination of two modules. The modules themselves are then used in conjunction with an inference engine, TEAMS-RT, which is part of Qualtech Systems integrated diagnostic toolset, to provide the end user with accurate diagnostic and prognostic information about the state of the system. The first module is a filter used to "clean" observed test results from multiple sensors from system noise. The sensors have false alarm and missed detection probabilities that are not known a-priori, and must be estimated - ideally along with the accuracies of these estimates - online, within the inference engine. Further, recognizing a practical concern in most real systems, a sparsely instantiated observation vector must not be problematic. Multiple hypothesis tracking (MHT) is at the heart of the filtering algorithm and beta prior distributions are applied to the sensor errors. The second module is a prognostic engine that uses an interacting multiple model (IMM) approach to track the "trajectory" of degrading sensors. Kalman filters estimate the movement in each dimension of the sensors. The current state and trajectory of each sensor is then used to predict the time to failure value, i.e., when the component corresponding to the sensor is no longer usable. The modules are integrated together and as part of the TEAMS-RT suite; logic is presented for the cases that they disagree.

AB  - A decision tree algorithm for fault detection and isolation of additive sensor faults in an inertial measurement unit (IMU) is presented. The algorithm is trained and validated using real measurements with an extended Kalman filter (EKF) implemented on hardware in a production vehicle. The measurement data is cleaned from faulty measurements using different clustering algorithms , i.e., K-means, hierarchical clustering and density based clustering for applications with noise (DBSCAN). Then, decision tree models are trained based on the output estimates of an EKF using the original IMU data. Two different classification problems are considered. First, the binary classification problem distinguishing between the cases nominal and faulty is considered. Second, the multi-class classification problem distinguishing between errors in all three acceleration and angular velocity signals is considered.

AB  - To predict the NOx emission level precisely in power station boiler, a data-driven method is presented to solve the problem of the absence of precision model. In this method, the operating data is utilized sufficiently to establish the model based on statistical learning theory. Firstly, the data on field is cleaned to avoid noise and abnormal value. To find the optimal model parameters, genetic algorithm is used for model optimization. So a modeling method is presented to describe the NOx emission level during varying load. The simulation is implemented on a 300MW coal-fired unit with several different working loads, and compared to the way based on neural network, the results show that the model can predict the NOx emission more precisely, which provides the foundation for further operating optimization.

AB  - One well-known difficulty in creating an effective human-machine interface via the speech input is the adverse effects of concurrent acoustic noise. To overcome this challenge, we have developed a joint hardware and software solution. A novel bone-conductive microphone is integrated with a regular air-conductive one in a single headset. These two simultaneous sensors capture the distinct signal properties in the speech embedded in acoustic noise. The focus of this paper is the exploration of the type of dynamic properties that are relatively invariant between the bone-conductive sensor's signal and the clean speech signal; the latter would not be available to the recognizer. Our approach is based on a nonlinear processing technique that estimates the unobserved (hidden) vocal tract resonances, as a representation of such invariant hidden dynamics, from the available bone-sensor signal. The information about these dynamic aspects of the clean speech is then fused with the other noisy measurements that aims to improve the recognition system's robustness to acoustic distortion. The fusion technique is based on a combination of three sets of signals including the synthesized speech signal using the vocal tract resonance dynamics extracted nonlinearly from the bone-sensor signal.

AB  - This paper presents a novel approach, adaptive spectrum noise cancellation (ASNC), for motion artifacts removal in photoplethysmography (PPG) signals measured by an optical biosensor to obtain clean PPG waveforms for heartbeat rate calculation. One challenge faced by this optical sensing method is the inevitable noise induced by movement when the user is in motion, especially when the motion frequency is very close to the target heartbeat rate. The proposed ASNC utilizes the onboard accelerometer and gyroscope sensors to detect and remove the artifacts adaptively, thus obtaining accurate heartbeat rate measurement while in motion. The ASNC algorithm makes use of a commonly accepted spectrum analysis approaches in medical digital signal processing, discrete cosine transform, to carry out frequency domain analysis. Results obtained by the proposed ASNC have been compared with the classic algorithms, the adaptive threshold peak detection and adaptive noise cancellation. The mean (standard deviation) absolute error and mean relative error of heartbeat rate calculated by ASNC is 0.33 (0.57) beats min-1 and 0.65%, by adaptive threshold peak detection algorithm is 2.29 (2.21) beats min-1 and 8.38%, by adaptive noise cancellation algorithm is 1.70 (1.50) beats min-1 and 2.02%. While all algorithms performed well with both simulated PPG data and clean PPG data collected from our verity device in situations free of motion artifacts, ASNC provided better accuracy when motion artifacts increase, especially when motion frequency is very close to the heartbeat rate.

AB  - This paper deals with the improvement of a noisy speech enhancement system based on the fusion of auditory and visual information. The system was presented in previous papers and implemented with a simple stimuli corrupted with white noise. Its principle consists of an analysis-enhancement-synthesis process based on a linear prediction (LP) model of the signal: the LP filter is enhanced thanks to associative tools that estimate the LP cleaned parameters from both noisy audio and lip shape information. The structure of the system is reviewed and we focus on the improvement that concerns the associators: multi-layers perceptrons are used instead of linear regression. It is shown that in the context of VCV transitions corrupted with white noise, the performances of the system are improved in terms of the intelligibility gain, distance measures and classification tests.

AB  - Depth perception is considered an invaluable source of information for various vision tasks. However, depth maps acquired using consumer-level sensors still suffer from non-negligible noise. This fact has recently motivated researchers to exploit traditional filters, as well as the deep learning paradigm, in order to suppress the aforementioned non-uniform noise, while preserving geometric details. Despite the effort, deep depth denoising is still an open challenge mainly due to the lack of clean data that could be used as ground truth. In this paper, we propose a fully convolutional deep autoencoder that learns to denoise depth maps, surpassing the lack of ground truth data. Specifically, the proposed autoencoder exploits multiple views of the same scene from different points of view in order to learn to suppress noise in a self-supervised end-to-end manner using depth and color information during training, yet only depth during inference. To enforce self-supervision, we leverage a differentiable rendering technique to exploit photometric supervision, which is further regularized using geometric and surface priors. As the proposed approach relies on raw data acquisition, a large RGB-D corpus is collected using Intel RealSense sensors. Complementary to a quantitative evaluation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed self-supervised denoising approach on established 3D reconstruction applications.

AB  - Describes a noise-resistant pulse oximetry algorithm suited to both signal reconstruction and oxygen saturation estimation. The algorithm first detects relatively clean signal sections from which the heart rate is estimated. The heart rate is used to construct a synthetic reference signal that matches an idealized pulse signal. An adaptive filter continuously processes the sensor signals, reconstructing signals in a linear subspace defined by the reference signal. A projective subspace algorithm is then applied to find the oxygenation level of the blood. The authors show that under specific circumstances this algorithm solves the sufficiency condition for signal reconstruction in linear saturation estimators. The core principle of using a frequency modulated synthetic reference signal can be applied to adaptive filtering of other physiological signals controlled by the heartbeat, such as blood pressure and electrocardiogram.

AB  - With the rapid development of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), sensor and wireless technologies, a large amount of trajectory data of moving objects are emerging, and trajectory data mining has received more and more attentions recently. However, since the data collected by sensors and RFID readers are usually noisy, it is necessary and meaningful to clean up the noise, including missing detection events and cross detection events, so as to provide high quality data for various applications using trajectory data. Cleaning up the trajectory events should take into account of uncertainty of location and unreliability of event detection at the same time. In the paper, we first discuss the rules to distinguish between normal detection events and false detection events in the trajectories, using constraints on continuous motion between adjacent detection regions and direct moving time between neighboring physical regions. Then, as a unified cleaning framework, we establish a probabilistic region connection graph to represent region detection features, region connection relationships, and region transition probabilities of neighboring physical regions. Focusing on interpolating missing events, we suggest two path-based probabilistic interpolating strategies, namely, the Most Likely Path (MLP) strategy and the Highest Weighting Probability Path (HWPP) strategy. Also, we discuss pruning rules of candidate paths for reducing computational cost. Finally, we conduct experiments over simulation data to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed methods.

AB  - In this paper, two models, the I-vector and the Gaussian Mixture Model-Universal Background Model (GMM-UBM), are compared for the speaker identification task. Four feature combinations of I-vectors with seven fusion techniques are considered: maximum, mean, weighted sum, cumulative, interleaving and concatenated for both two and four features. In addition, an Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is exploited to identify speakers, and then Speaker Identification Accuracy (SIA) is calculated. Both systems are evaluated for 120 speakers from the TIMIT and NIST 2008 databases for clean speech. Furthermore, a comprehensive evaluation is made under Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) conditions and with three types of Non Stationary Noise (NSN), both with and without handset effects for the TIMIT database. The results show that the I-vector approach is better than the GMM-UBM for both clean and AWGN conditions without a handset. However, the GMM-UBM had better accuracy for NSN types.

AB  - This paper presents the high building mirror cleaning robot control system (HMCR) which is the first step toward a complete implementation of the fully of intelligent exterior building cleaning system (IEBCS). Examples for these techniques are outdoor robots. The system can have three main importance roles that first for detected the signals from mirror detection areas such as image quantity and dirty level relatively with the sensor positions and after that compression process are proposed the image coding algorithms called wavelet transform with system error compensate via vector quantization techniques (VQ). The small bit rates for high-speed data transmission with a small space for data storage are required on wireless transceiver channel. Simultaneously, the peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) has to be maintained. The shape analysis with a continuous thinning algorithms are used in second step for reduced the sized of data and can be representatives for suitable features data. Finally the cleaning algorithms are designed both for normally mode and intelligent mode that applied by fuzzy rule based algorithms on the programmable logic controller (PLC) with fuzzy ladder control technique (FLC). By applying the proposed method, performance has been improved which indicated by lower bit rate and better PSNR. Some results from natural scenes are shown that system performance can work well and is valid to detect the other kinds of mirror area that would train the mobile robot to perform some task at that place.

AB  - An assessment of electrocardiogram (ECG) signal quality has become an unavoidable first step in most holter and ambulatory ECG signal analysis applications. In this paper, we present a simple method for automatically detection and classification of ECG noises. The proposed method consists of four major steps: moving average filter, blocking, feature extraction, and multistage decision-tree algorithm. In the proposed method, the dynamic amplitude range and autocorrelation maximum peak features are extracted for each block. In the first decision stage, a amplitude-dependent decision rule is used for detecting the presence of low-frequency (LF) noise (including, baseline wander (BW) and abrupt change (ABC) artifacts) and the high-frequency (HF) noise (including, power line interference (PLI) and muscle artifacts). In the second decision stage, the proposed method further classifies the LF noise into a BW noise or a ABC noise using the local dynamic amplitude range feature. The HF noise is classified into a PLI noise or a muscle noise using the local autocorrelation maximum peak feature. The proposed detection and classification method is tested and validated using a wide variety of clean and noisy ECG signals. Results show that the method can achieve an average sensitivity (Se) of 97.88%, positive productivity (+P) of 91.18% and accuracy of 89.06%.

AB  - A laser absorption sensor for carbon monoxide concentration was developed for combustion studies in a rapid compression machine using a pulsed quantum cascade laser near 4.89 μm. Cavity enhancement reduced minimum detection limit down to 2.4 ppm at combustion relevant conditions. Off-axis alignment and rapid intra-pulse down-chirp resulted in effective suppression of cavity noise.

AB  - Wireless communications employing 60 GHz millimeter wave are quite attractive recently due to the huge clean unlicensed bandwidth (up to 7 GHz) in this frequency band. In this paper, aiming at increasing channel capacity and improving the reliability of non-line-of-sight (NLOS) indoor wireless communications, we focus on a first-order-reflection multiple input multiple output (MIMO) model for 60 GHz wireless local area network (WLAN) systems based on the short-range indoor scenario provided by IEEE Std 802.11ad. Considering the special physical properties of 60 GHz millimeter wave in such scenario, we use large scale planar antenna arrays at both transmitter and receiver to eliminate link level interference. The antenna arrays are divided into several sub-arrays and each sub-array is considered as a high-gain steerable directional antenna unit. The essential characteristics of the physical layer of this model is to adjust these antenna units along different first-order-reflection clusters from walls or ceiling simultaneously at both transmitter and receiver to get several parallel channel links. System level simulation results demonstrate that the proposed model with multiple first-order-reflection links can increase the channel capacity for several times compared to the original model in this scenario.

AB  - Hyperspectral images (HSIs) are usually corrupted by various noises, e.g., Gaussian noise, impulse noise, stripes, dead lines, and many others. In this article, motivated by the good performance of the L1-2 nonconvex metric in image sparse structure exploitation, we first develop a 3-D L1-2 spatial-spectral total variation ( L1-2SSTV) regularization to globally represent the sparse prior in the gradient domain of HSIs. Then, we divide HSIs into local overlapping 3-D patches, and low-rank tensor recovery (LTR) is locally used to effectively separate the low-rank clean HSI patches from complex noise. The patchwise LTR can not only adapt to the local low-rank property of HSIs well but also significantly reduce the information loss caused by the global LTR. Finally, integrating the advantages of both the global L1-2SSTV regularization and local LTR model, we propose a L1-2SSTV regularized local LTR model for hyperspectral restoration. In the framework of the alternating direction method of multipliers, the difference of convex algorithm, the split Bregman iteration method, and tensor singular value decomposition method are adopted to solve the proposed model efficiently. Simulated and real HSI experiments show that the proposed model can reduce the dependence on noise independent and identical distribution hypotheses, and simultaneously remove various types of noise, even structure-related noise.

AB  - Physiological features extraction from Motion Artifacts (MA) corrupted Photoplethysmography (PPG) signals are of great difficulty due to the non-linear interaction between clean PPG and noise. To accurately extract features such as heart rate, blood pressure, and Oxygen Saturation in Blood, a robust PPG de-noising and waveform recovering method is required. However, traditional adaptive filtering or signal decomposition methods fail to achieve this goal. In this paper, a Signal-Noise Interaction modeling based algorithm for motion artifacts removal (SniMA) under strenuous physical exercise utilizing Envelope Filtering (EF) and Time-Delay Neural Network (TDNN) is proposed. Envelope Filtering normalizes raw data and eliminates imbalance training problem for neural networks, while TDNN is a hidden-state included method aiming at modeling PPG signal-noise interaction. An accelerometer as well as a gyroscope functions as the noise reference. Results comparing 8 performance indexes extracted from 4 types of waveform related features (heart rate, waveform correlation, pulse width, and pulse area) on an open access dataset we built show SniMA's effectiveness for PPG MA removal. The proposed algorithm provides a significant improvement in PPG waveform recovery and PPG feature estimation accuracy. This is the first time that a TDNN has been introduced for PPG de-noising. This study also indicates the potential of other hidden-state involved signal-noise interaction modeling methods for PPG de-noising.

AB  - Conventional radar-based people counting systems are designed mainly for dense spatial distributions in a small region of interest (ROI). Therefore, a system with only conventional energy-based features, which are effective for a small ROI with a limited spatial distribution of individuals, generally fails to cope with the diverse and complex spatial distributions that arise from the freer movements of individuals as the ROI widens. To address this problem, a novel approach that achieves robust people counting in both wide and small ROIs is presented in this study. The proposed technique incorporates modified CLEAN-based features in the range domain and energy-based features in the frequency domain to efficiently address both dense and dispersed distributions of individuals. Subsequently, principal component analysis and an appropriate normalization of the proposed features are performed for improving the people counting system further. Based on several experiments in practical environments with wide ROIs and severe multipath effects, we observed that the proposed approach yields significantly improved performance compared with traditional people counting systems.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to remove the Gaussian Noise present in seismic signals obtained in the Llaima volcano, one of the most active volcanoes in Chile. In order to classify subsequently, the methods used to clean the seismic signals are usually band pass Butterworth filter for its low ripple to reduce interference from other sources of mechanical energy to provide low frequency components. However, these methods are unable to eliminate white Gaussian noise present in seismic signal samples, which affects the observation signals that are too weak to show slightly above the noise, thereby preventing classification. The methods used in this study to eliminate the white noise spectral subtraction are consisting of narrow samples and then subtract noise in the frequency domain and the modified Wiener filter that using the statistical method of least squares generates clarification signal. When comparing both methods, it was observed that the Wiener filter has greater effectiveness in cleaning the noise when owning an iterative noise estimation. The development of these methods applied to the investigation of seismic signals provides information of seismic events that are of low intensity for further observation.

AB  - Recent studies have made great progress on skeleton-based action recognition. However, most of them are developed with relatively clean skeletons without the presence of intensive noise. We argue that the models learned from relatively clean data are not well generalizable to handle noisy skeletons commonly appeared in the real world. In this paper, we address the challenge of recognizing human actions from noisy skeletons, which is seldom explored by previous methods. Beyond exploring the new problem, we further take a new perspective to address it, i.e., noise adaptation, which gets rid of explicit skeleton noise modeling and reliance on skeleton ground truths. Specifically, we develop regression-based and generation-based adaptation models according to whether pairs of noisy skeletons are available. The regression-based model aims to learn noise-suppressed intrinsic feature representations by mapping pairs of noisy skeletons into a noise-robust space. When only unpaired skeletons are accessible, the generation-based model aims to adapt the features from noisy skeletons to a low-noise space by adversarial learning. To verify our proposed model and facilitate research on noisy skeletons, we collect a new dataset Noisy Skeleton Dataset (NSD), the skeletons of which are with much noise and more similar to daily-life data than previous datasets. Extensive experiments are conducted on the NSD, VV-RGBD and N-UCLA datasets, and results consistently show the outstanding performance of our proposed model.

AB  - Heart sound is a valuable biosignal for early detection of a large set of cardiac diseases. Ambient and physiological noise interference is one of the most usual and high probable incidents during heart sound acquisition. It may change the prominent and crucial characteristics of heart sound which may possess important information for heart disease diagnosis. In this paper, we propose a new method to detect ambient and internal body noises in heart sounds. The algorithm utilizes physiologically inspired periodicity/semi-periodicity criteria. A small segment of clean heart sound exhibiting periodicity in the time and in the frequency domain is first detected. The sound segment is used as a template to detect uncontaminated heart sounds during recording. The technique has been tested on the heart sounds contaminated with several types of noises, recorded from 68 different subjects. Average sensitivity of 95.13% and specificity of 98.65% for non-cardiac sound detection were achieved.

AB  - This paper presents an adaptive notch filter to achieve more accurate demodulation variables in the method of averaging. The main advantage of this notch filter is a very sharp attenuation gain at twice of the estimated resonance frequency, which is the main frequency component of the oscillatory noise in the demodulated variables. The position of the sharp attenuation gain can be adjusted in real time to catch the resonator's resonance frequency change. As a result, it can demodulate the control variables up to very high accuracy. Performing the method of averaging on the cleaner signals will result in much higher rotation angle estimation accuracy when the method of averaging is running in the whole angle mode. Simulation results show that with the adaptive notch filter, the oscillation in the system's quadrature and precession angle can be eliminated very well. The adaptive notch filter also effectively reduces the DC drift in the precession angle.

AB  - Given a sensor network, TDOA self-calibration aims at simultaneously estimating the positions of receivers and transmitters, and transmitters time offsets. This can be formulated as a system of polynomial equations. Due to the elevated number of unknowns and the nonlinearity of the problem, obtaining an accurate solution efficiently is nontrivial. Previous work has shown that iterative algorithms are sensitive to initialization and little noise can lead to failure in convergence. Hence, research has focused on algebraic techniques. Stable and efficient algebraic solvers have been proposed for some network configurations, but they do not work for smaller networks. In this paper, we use homotopy continuation to solve four previously unsolved configurations in 2D TDOA self-calibration, including a minimal one. As a theoretical contribution, we investigate the number of solutions of the new minimal configuration, showing this is much lower than previous estimates. As a more practical contribution, we also present new subminimal solvers, which can be used to achieve unique accurate solutions in previously unsolvable configurations. We demonstrate our solvers are stable both with clean and noisy data, even without nonlinear refinement afterwards. Moreover, we demonstrate the suitability of homotopy continuation for sensor network calibration problems, opening prospects to new applications.

AB  - This paper presents an image destriping system for correcting striping noise of remote-sensing images. The developed system identifies stripe positions based on edge-detection and line-tracing algorithms. Pixels not affected by striping are used as control points to construct cubic spline functions describing spatial gray level distributions of an image. Detected stripes are corrected by replacing the pixels with more reasonable gray values computed from constructed spline functions. Gray values of clean pixels not affected by stripes are not altered to preserve data genuineness. Several experimental results demonstrate that the developed system can correctly detect stripes in remote-sensing images and effectively repair them. Evaluations of the results based on an quantitative image quality index indicate that the image quality has been improved significantly after destriping. The destriped images are not only visually more plausible but also can provide better interpretability and are more suitable for computerized analysis.

AB  - The present contribution concerns the activities carried out in the Clean Sky GRC5 MANOEUVRES project. The overall goal of the project is to provide an innovative system to monitor rotorcraft noise in flight, in view of performing optimized low-noise terminal procedures. To achieve this goal it is necessary to estimate in real time the main rotor tip-path plane (TPP) orientation with respect to the vehicle airspeed vector, which in turn depends on the TPP orientation with respect to the helicopter airframe. An in-flight contactless measuring system, capable of measuring the three angles of a helicopter blade with respect to the hub, is proposed and validated. Its development is detailed, starting from the selection of candidate technologies up to the final demonstration of a prototypal device on board an AgustaWestland AW139 prototype helicopter.

AB  - We describe a novel technique for multi-sensory speech processing for enhancing noisy speech and for improved noise-robust speech recognition. Both air- and bone-conductive microphones are used to capture speech data where the bone sensor contains virtually noise-free hidden dynamic information of clean speech in the form of formant trajectories. The distortion in the bone-sensor signal such as teeth-clacking and noise leakage can be effectively removed by making use of the automatically extracted formant information from the bone-sensor signal. This paper reports an improved technique for synthesizing speech waveforms based on the LPC cepstra computed analytically from the formant trajectories. When this new signal stream is fused with the other available speech data streams, we achieved improved performance for noisy speech recognition.

AB  - We propose a method to estimate the short term predictor (STP) and the long-term predictor (LTP) under noisy conditions. We assume the speech signal to be a single, dual or triple frame asymptotic mean stationary process. The a priori STP parameter distribution is represented as databases sampled from the speech training data. Stochastic integration is used to obtain the minimum mean square error estimates of the STP parameters. After computing the STP parameters, the LTP parameters from a database of pairs of taps and excitation variances are matched, together with the lag, using a likelihood criterion, to the noisy speech. The estimated STP and LTP parameters are also applied to obtain clean speech estimates by means of a Wiener or a Kalman filter. For car noise with an SNR of -5dB, the proposed enhancement method gives a mean opinion score of 3.3 as measured using the perceptual speech quality measure software.

AB  - Abnormalities in the heart's electrical signal can lead to irregularities in the heart normal rhythm or can entirely collapse the functioning of the heart. An electrocardiogram (ECG) measures the heart's electrical activity and contains many features that are indicative of such irregularities. This paper presents a novel strategy for detecting the irregularities in the heart rhythm from the recorded ECG signal using a combination of software and hardware tools. MWCNT/PDMS composite based dry electrodes are used to record the ECG signal for both static and with some physical activities. The least mean square (LMS) algorithm based adaptive filtering is implemented to acquire motion-free, clean, and reliable ECG data. The adaptive filtering exhibits the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as 42 dB, which demonstrates the efficiency of the filtering by ~8% compared to the raw ECG data. Once a clean ECG signal is acquired, it is sent for further processing and features of interest are extracted in LabVIEW that could be used to detect any abnormalities in the ECG signal. Overall, the proposed strategy helps in identifying heart rhythm irregularities quickly, accurately, and efficiently.

AB  - A novel classification scheme is proposed to categorize airplane targets into three kinds, i.e., turbojet aircraft, prop aircraft, and helicopter based on the jet engine modulation (JEM) characteristics of their low resolution radar echoes. From the pattern classification viewpoint, the low-dimensional feature vector is extracted via a two-step feature extraction algorithm based on empirical mode decomposition method and CLEAN technique. The feature extraction method can separate the fuselage component and JEM component in the target echo, and sufficiently utilize the information within or between the two components to extract the discriminative features for the three kinds of aircrafts. In addition, because the noise level of a test sample is usually different from those of the training samples in the real application, a simple and efficient preprocessing method is proposed for the classification stage to denoise the received test sample. Experimental results based on the simulated and measured data are presented, including the performance analysis for different dwell time, pulse repeat frequency (PRF) or signal-noise-ratio (SNR) cases and comparison with some related methods.

AB  - This paper describes the cooling concept of a DVD Video Recorder from both thermal and acoustic point of view. The DVD recorder consists of a cabinet with DVD engine, power supply and analogue and digital boards. In order to guarantee long life it is best to cool the DVD engine by clean air. But free convection cooling is not an option due to temperature problems of the DVD laser and other critical components in the set. A solution to this problem is to supply cool, filtered air to the DVD engine by means of a fan-filter assembly and to cool the rest of the cabinet with appropriate cooling slots in the bottom plate and a fan on the back-plate of the cabinet. While it is not difficult to meet the temperature specification of the DVD laser by appropriate fan choice usually the sound level will be too high. To bring this level down sound power measurements were done in a reverberant room for different combinations of fan voltages. These results are combined with temperature measurements of the delta T of the DVD laser. From the resulting noise-temperature curves an appropriate choice of fan voltages could be made. A temperature sensor in the cabinet senses the outside ambient. At high ambient temperatures the fans ran at higher speed. At lower ambient the fan speed is reduced to keep the noise level of the set as low as possible. A reduction of 10 dBA is obtained up to 28/spl deg/C ambient.

AB  - This paper deals with the problem of predicting the average intelligibility of noisy and potentially processed speech signals, as observed by a group of normal hearing listeners. We propose a model which performs this prediction based on the hypothesis that intelligibility is monotonically related to the mutual information between critical-band amplitude envelopes of the clean signal and the corresponding noisy/processed signal. The resulting intelligibility predictor turns out to be a simple function of the mean-square error (mse) that arises when estimating a clean critical-band amplitude using a minimum mean-square error (mmse) estimator based on the noisy/processed amplitude. The proposed model predicts that speech intelligibility cannot be improved by any processing of noisy critical-band amplitudes. Furthermore, the proposed intelligibility predictor performs well ( ρ > 0.95) in predicting the intelligibility of speech signals contaminated by additive noise and potentially non-linearly processed using time-frequency weighting.

AB  - Deep learning on an edge device requires energy efficient operation due to ever diminishing power budget. Intentional low quality data during the data acquisition for longer battery life, and natural noise from the low cost sensor degrade the quality of target output which hinders adoption of deep learning on an edge device. To overcome these problems, we propose simple yet efficient mixture of pre-processing experts (MoPE) model to handle various image distortions including low resolution and noisy images. We also propose to use adversarially trained auto encoder as a pre-processing expert for the noisy images. We evaluate our proposed method for various machine learning tasks including object detection on MS-COCO 2014 dataset, multiple object tracking problem on MOT-Challenge dataset, and human activity classification on UCF 101 dataset. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves better detection, tracking and activity classification accuracies under noise without sacrificing accuracies for the clean images. The overheads of our proposed MoPE are 0.67% and 0.17% in terms of memory and computation compared to the baseline object detection network.

AB  - The measurement of oxygen saturation using pulse oximeters requires clean photoplethysmograph (PPG) signals, as motion artifacts often lead to a significant degree of error in the computation. This paper proposes a method for reducing motion artifacts from corrupted PPG signals by applying a normalized least mean squares (NLMS) algorithm, using an isobestic point wavelength (800nm) as a noise reference signal for the adaptive filter. A finger ring type sensor was demonstrated to be more comfortable than a clip type sensor. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method is suitable for reconstructing PPG signals and improving the accuracy of measuring oxygen saturation in the blood.

AB  - Automatic food intake monitoring using wearable systems is a promising research direction in the fight against obesity and eating disorders. Previous work has indicated progress towards automatic food intake monitoring using acoustic sensors for detecting periods of food intake, swallowing and chewing detection, and discriminating between solid and liquid food intake. However, little effort has been put towards acoustic detection in noisy recordings. In this paper, we explore detecting food intake events (particularly chew events) in the presence of restaurant background noise. Three templates were extracted from a clean signal to represent the beginning, middle and end phase of a chewing sequence. Then, each template was used with sliding window correlation to detect chew events in a noisy recording. The noisy signal was formed by instantaneous addition of a clean throat microphone recording during eating and restaurant noise recorded with the same throat microphone. Results show that the template created from the end phase of a chewing sequence outperformed templates from the beginning and middle phases for detecting chew events in a continuous clean and noisy test signal. An F1 score of 71.4% was achieved for detecting chews in very low signal-to-noise ratio of -10 dB.

AB  - Remote health care monitoring is an emerging application that helps to reduce the cost of health care and at the same time improve its quality. However, by its nature, medical sensor data is often unreliable and massive as the data is collected from numerous sensors operating in noisy environments. Therefore, ensuring the reliability of the sensor data and the scalability of the health care monitoring services are among major challenge and is a determining factor in the success of the system. In this paper, we propose a robust and flexible preprocessing module as part of an active health care monitoring framework. It is responsible for preparing the sensor data and performing some initial assessment of the data for input to later modules. The proposed preprocessing architecture contains five stages: validation, transformation, cleaning, reduction and cross-verification. The module is evaluated using synthetic blood pressure data.

AB  - Several bandwise total variation (TV) regularized low-rank (LR)-based models have been proposed to remove mixed noise in hyperspectral images (HSIs). These methods convert high-dimensional HSI data into 2-D data based on LR matrix factorization. This strategy introduces the loss of useful multiway structure information. Moreover, these bandwise TV-based methods exploit the spatial information in a separate manner. To cope with these problems, we propose a spatial–spectral TV regularized LR tensor factorization (SSTV-LRTF) method to remove mixed noise in HSIs. From one aspect, the hyperspectral data are assumed to lie in an LR tensor, which can exploit the inherent tensorial structure of hyperspectral data. The LRTF-based method can effectively separate the LR clean image from sparse noise. From another aspect, HSIs are assumed to be piecewisely smooth in the spatial domain. The TV regularization is effective in preserving the spatial piecewise smoothness and removing Gaussian noise. These facts inspire the integration of the LRTF with TV regularization. To address the limitations of bandwise TV, we use the SSTV regularization to simultaneously consider local spatial structure and spectral correlation of neighboring bands. Both simulated and real data experiments demonstrate that the proposed SSTV-LRTF method achieves superior performance for HSI mixed-noise removal, as compared to the state-of-the-art TV regularized and LR-based methods.

The scheme considers the way in which a signal from receivers or sensors (induction machine) is processed and used to de-noise the signal. The scheme are illustrated through an application that processes raw signals (speed, torque, phase-current and rotor flux) of an induction motor drive. The results shows that the wavelet based denoising scheme results in more noise reduction. The scheme generates a clean and useful induction machine signals (speed, torque, phase-current and rotor flux). The simulation results are presented for three-phase and five-phase induction motor drives.

AB  - In this paper we present a novel use of an acoustic Doppler sonar for multi-modal speaker identification. An ultrasonic emitter directs a 40 kHz tone toward the speaker. Reflections from the speaker's face are recorded as the speaker talks. The frequency of the tone is modified by the velocity of the facial structures it is reflected by. The received ultrasonic signal thus contains an entire spectrum of frequencies representing the set of all velocities of facial components. The pattern of frequencies in the reflected signal is observed to be typical of the speaker. The captured ultrasonic signal is synchronously analyzed with the corresponding voice signal to extract specific characteristics that can be used to identify the speaker. Experiments show that the information this can result in significant improvements in speaker identification accuracy both under clean conditions and in noise.

AB  - Due to emerging development of intelligent sensing technologies in Internet of Things, multisensor cooperation has been widely deployed in applications. Although multisensor information fusion can be addressed by multiview learning, its performance tends to degrade if any one sensor is disturbed with annoying noises by the environment or other factors. Therefore, fusing these cross-sensor data in a reliable and secure manner while removing those noises is crucial. Although there have been outlier-against multiview works proposed, most of them suffer from redundant parameters or performance degradation. Even worse, few of them have considered the complementary information across the sensors. In this article, we argue that in multiview information fusion, not only the clean data, but also those outliers share the same prototypes in a common space, except that the outliers are disturbed with noises. To this end, we propose a type of robust multiview prototype (RMVP) learning to fuse the sensing data while removing the noises automatically in the learning process. Specifically, in RMVP, projection matrices are designed for each sensing view to sketch the data prototypes. In addition, one auxiliary margin matrix is modeled for each sensing view to capture its data noises through penalizing a sparsity regularization on it. Afterwards, an alternating algorithm is presented to solve the proposed model. Finally, extensive experiments on intelligent sensing data sets are conducted to testify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB  - Coal washing plants in coal mines use vibrating screens to size coal according to customer specifications and plant design. Screens are mostly used in coal washing plants, which are further used to size Run-Off-Mine coal (ROM) material after crushing them to a reduced size using roller crushers to classify bulk material and de-watering. However, the lack of/or limited safety measures on sizing screens leads to increased unmonitored noise levels caused by high vibrations, and constant damage to screen equipment, which leads to unplanned maintenance and production loss. This creates a health issue to plant employees and compromises machine safety while shortening the screens lifespan. Therefore, the paper seeks to design a monitoring and protection system for a vibrating coal sizing screen. This is done by using a vibration motion and noise sensor in order to monitor and protect the screens. By monitoring the vibration motion, messages are sent to the process and control room for further decision making. Thus, these will assist in the sequence of screen and machine stops before failure. Moreover, this enables proper maintenance scheduling and prevents extensive damage to vibrating screens.

AB  - Fault detection of nonlinear systems become more feasible when it is conducted over Takagi-Sugeno (TS) approximated fuzzy models. Proportional plus integral observer (PIO) and robust observer (RO) have already been developed for the estimation of the system states and actuator/sensor faults. In this paper, the algorithms are implemented for the detection of valve and level sensor faults of a two-tank system. Our simulation results indicate that both algorithms run well in estimating states and sensor fault, however, there is obvious differences in how they detect actuator fault in the presence of noise. From viewpoint of estimation variance, RO renders cleaner estimate of the fault than PIO, whiles PIO has faster fault tracking speed than RO. According to the achieving result, RO algorithm is recognized to be a more attractive in estimating actuator faults in noisy environments. The results are validated through simulations.

AB  - Summary form only given. A fundamental requirement of coherent detection systems for optimal performance is the necessity for wavefront-matching of a received signal to that of a local oscillator. In light of the potential applications of lasers to remote sensing for manufacturing process control using laser-based ultrasound and the renewed interest in free-space optical communication networks, the optics community has been motivated to examine how one can improve the performance of coherent receivers in the face of highly aberrated signal beams. In general, the antenna theorem states that a huge penalty in signal-to-noise is experienced (upwards of 30 dB) when dealing with signals that contain many spatial modes. It is therefore incumbent that one consider real-time methods to provide for beam clean-up or wavefront-matching of dynamically varying phase-fronts to a local oscillator. In this tutorial, we discuss and compare a variety of nonlinear optical techniques to achieve these goals. Examples include phase-conjugate mirrors, double-pumped phase-conjugate mirrors, two-wave mixers, and nonsteady-state photo-induced EMF sensors. The latter has the novel property of combining real-time holographic wavefront-matching with photoconductive detection, all in a single nonlinear optical element. The elegance of all these devices is that they proceed via "all-optical" techniques and do not require computationally intensive processing.

AB  - The exploration of water bodies from the sea to land filled water spaces has seen a continuous increase with new technologies such as robotics. Underwater images is one of the main sensor resources used but suffer from added problems due to the environment. Multiple methods and techniques have provided a way to correct the color, clear the poor quality and enhance the features. In this paper, we present the work of an Image Cleaning and Enhancement Technique which is based on performing color correction on images incorporated with Dark Channel Prior(DCP) and then taking the converted images and modifying them into the Long, Medium and Short(LMS) color space, as this space is the region in which the human eye perceives colour. This work is being developed at INESC TEC robotics and autonomous systems laboratory. Our objective is to improve the quality of images for and taken by robots with the particular emphasis on underwater flooded mines. The paper describes the architecture and the developed solution. A comparative analysis with state of the art methods and of our proposed solution is presented. Results from missions taken by the robot in operational mine scenarios are presented and discussed and allowing for the solution characterization and validation.

AB  - Kettering University’s Clean Snowmobile Challenge student design team has developed a new robust and innovative snowmobile for the 2005 competition. This snowmobile dramatically reduces exhaust and noise emissions and improves fuel economy compared with a conventional snowmobile. Kettering University has utilized a modified snowmobile in-line four cylinder, fourstroke, engine. The team added an electronically controlled fuel-injection system with oxygen sensor feedback to this engine. This engine has been installed into a 2003 Yamaha RX-1 snowmobile chassis. Exhaust emissions have been further minimized through the use of a customized catalytic converter and an electronically controlled closed-loop fuel injection system. A newly designed and tuned exhaust as well as several chassis treatments have aided in minimizing noise emissions.

AB  - The observation of the passenger compartment using an interior RADAR becomes challenging when a vehicle is in motion. The signal received by the RADAR sensor measures not only the target's motion that we would like to detect, e.g., vital signs, but also a second, unwanted motion induced by exterior effects, e.g., displacement caused by the road, strong wind gusts, or car engine vibrations. Consequently, traditional techniques used to remove white Gaussian noise cannot be applied in this scenario. We propose a theoretical framework to investigate the denoising of a signal received by an interior RADAR using accelerometer measurements and a mechanical model to generate the cancellation signal stemming from the (unwanted) vibrational motion. We explain the denoising technique and show that the fundamental idea behind the cleaning process works well. Our observations are corroborated by a robust mathematical model and verified by simulations. Furthermore, the aforementioned denoising techniques enable us to formulate and solve an optimization problem to find an estimation for the passenger's mass in certain cases.

AB  - Stream data which is common usually suffers from dirty data points due to noise interference, unreliable sensor reading, erroneous extraction of stock prices or other various reasons. Existing smoothing filter based data cleaning methods seriously alter the data without preserving the original information. And the others such as SCREEN need to be guided by some semantic constraints in specific application scenarios. To improve the usability, we propose a method called TsRss, which is a practical stream data cleaning method based on local shape feature (Shape-Sheet). TsRss is based on the basic idea that data points failing to match its local shape features are more likely to be dirty. To this end, we first study the methods of generating and representing unequal-length Shape-Sheets based on the local shape features. Then the method for finding dirty data via anomaly detection is proposed based on Shape-Sheet. Finally, experiments were conducted on several real datasets. The result showed that TsRss was more practical in use on various types of data, more accurate or more time-saving compared with state-of-the-art methods.

AB  - Deconvolution is essential for radio interferometric imaging to produce scientific quality data because of finite sampling in the Fourier plane. Most deconvolution algorithms are based on CLEAN which uses a grid of image pixels, or clean components. A critical matter in this process is the selection of pixel size for optimal results in deconvolution. As a rule of thumb, the pixel size is chosen smaller than the resolution dictated by the interferometer. For images consisting of unresolved (or point like) sources, this approach yields optimal results. However, for sources that are not point like, in particular for partially resolved sources, the selection of right pixel size is still an open issue. In this paper, we investigate the limitations of pixelization in deconvolving extended sources. In particular, we pursue the usage of orthonormal basis functions to model extended sources yielding better results than by using clean components.

When the output measurements are noisy, it is shown that the (noise-free) clean state of the system can be recovered asymptotically as the number of the coupled observers grows by synchronizing a group of complete-order observers. Contraction analysis enables to establish exponential convergence of the state estimate to the system state. Application to a perspective vision system is considered.

AB  - Magnetic cleanliness has become an important and design driving requirement for satellites and components on most scientific missions. Main contributors to the disturbing magnetic fields of a satellite are the reaction wheels. Their internal design (electric motors, ferromagnetic parts) and high-speed operation, result in significant electromagnetic stray fields in various frequency ranges. To meet magnetic cleanliness requirements, reaction wheels are often housed in additional shielding on-board the satellite. This results in a significant mass increase and requires more magnetic (shielding) material on-board the satellite. Previous works have described the on-going efforts in the magnetically clean reaction wheel design [1] [2] [3] [4]. This paper summarizes these efforts and describes the results of the magnetically clean reaction wheel project. Magnetic field mitigation techniques have been implemented in the new wheel EQM (Engineering Qualification Model) and the final impact on the magnetic footprint is discussed.

AB  - Effective detection and classification of systolic and diastolic profiles in Phonocardiogram (PCG) are challenging not only due to the presence of other cardiac events but also due to the presence of non-cardiac events such as lung sounds, and speech. Due to the proximity of lungs and epiglottis with heart, the interference of lung sounds, and speech are unavoidable while recording PCG (from the subjects who suffer from respiratory dysfunction, cough, mental illness, etc.) using electronic stethoscope. This work presents a method for automatic classification of systolic and diastolic profiles of PCG corrupted with several noise components. The method involves constructing a unique dictionary matrix that captures the morphology of PCG signal and the noises which affects the fundamental heart sounds. The PCG signal is then decomposed over the dictionary matrix using sparse signal decomposition (SSD). The low frequency clean PCG signal with enhanced S1 and S2 sounds is then reconstructed by eliminating frequency components corresponding to various noises. Finally, by computing the Shannon entropy envelope followed by simple thresholding, S1 and S2 sounds are segmented. Time duration features obtained from segmentation are used for the classification of systolic and diastolic profiles. For the automated classification, hidden semi Markov model (HSMM), multilayer perceptron (MLP), support vector machine (SVM), and k nearest neighbor (KNN) classifiers are utilized and compared the performance metrics of the classifiers. To validate the proposed method, both real-time recorded PCG signals and signals taken from standard databases are considered. The proposed SSD based heart sound segmentation achieves an average accuracy of 99.55% for clean PCG, 99.23% for PCG corrupted with baseline wander (BW) and additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN), 99.44% for standard database, 99.18% for PCG corrupted with lung sounds, and 98.47% for PCG corrupted with speech. HSMM classifier results better classification F-measure over MLP, SVM, and KNN. The average F-measure of HSMM classifier for systolic and diastolic profiles classification of PCG is 96.74%.

We present the mechanical design, finite element simulations and experimental characterization of the high-speed scanner, showing exceptionally clean dynamics, high linearity and large actuation bandwidth. The scanner is equipped with a magneto-resistive position sensing scheme that provides subnanometer resolution over a large bandwidth. Advanced model-based feedback controllers are designed according to a newly developed control design architecture with direct shaping of the closed-loop noise sensitivity and experimental results are presented in which the dual-stage system is used for high-speed imaging in a custom-built atomic force microscope.

AB  - Recently, following the success of neural networks, image denoising has achieved great improvements. However, it is challenging to construct an efficient denoising model with excellent performance and less computation. In this paper, we propose an extremely lightweight framework to remove real image noise in denoising-friendly space. Specif-ically, we apply the wavelet transform to project the noisy image and feature maps into low and high frequency domain, which decouples the noise information from the clean ones to a certain extent, thereby reducing the difficulty of denoising task. In addition, we further introduce a lightweight op-erator called Grouped Shift Module (GSM) into our denoising network, hence much heavy computation can be saved. Experimental results on the current benchmark demonstrate that our Wavelet Shift Denoising Network (WSNet) even achieves PSNR 39.28 dB with only 3G FLOPs on the SIDD benchmark.

We show that the tightest upper bound is the MVDR dirty image. We propose using active-set methods to solve the imaging problem and show that this algorithm is strongly related to sequential source removal techniques like the CLEAN. Also recent studies show the relation between non-negativity and sparsity which means that the proposed optimization also benefits from sparsity in an automatic way.

AB  - Acoustic waves induced by leakage attenuate as they propagate in the piping system. Difficulties are generally encountered in leak localization in plastic pipes since these waves are heavily attenuated than in metallic pipes. This study presents a leak localization method based on the variable step normalized least mean square (VS-LMS) adaptive filter. In the method, the optimal weight vector of the filter is determined for time delay estimation (TDE) without requirement of the prior knowledge of statistical characteristics of leak and noise signals. It has a desirable feature of sharpening the main peak of TDE curve through adaptive iterative learning process, thus improving the accuracy of TDE for leak localization. By adjusting the update mode of iteration step, the convergence speed of the VS-LMS algorithm can be greatly improved. A simulation model of leak wave propagation is established and is subsequently analyzed for leak localization with respects to the TDE accuracy. Experimental work is further carried out on a plastic pipe to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The simulation sand experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the original LMS and basic cross-correlation methods for the leak localization in a water-filled plastic pipe.

AB  - Automatic food intake monitoring can be significantly beneficial in the fight against obesity and weight management in our society today. Different sensing modalities have been used in several research efforts to accomplish automatic food intake monitoring with acoustic sensors being the most common. In this study, we explore the ability to learn spectral patterns of food intake acoustics from a clean signal and use this learned patterns for extracting the signal of interest from a noisy recording. Using standard metrics for evaluation of blind source separation, namely signal to distortion ratio and signal to interference ratio, we observed up to 20dB improvement of separation quality in very low signal to noise ratio conditions. For more practical performance evaluation of food intake monitoring, we compared the detection accuracy for chew events on the mixed/noisy signal versus on the estimated/separated target signal. We observed up to 60% improvement in chew event detection accuracy for low signal to noise ratio conditions when using the estimated target signal compared to when using the mixed/noisy signal.

AB  - In this paper, a new combination of features and normalization methods is investigated for robust biometric speaker identification. Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) are efficient for speaker identification in clean speech while Power Normalized Cepstral Coefficients (PNCC) features are robust for noisy environments. Therefore, combining both features together is better than taking each one individually. In addition, Cepstral Mean and Variance Normalization (CMVN) and Feature Warping (FW) are used to mitigate possible channel effects and the handset mismatch in voice measurements. Speaker modelling is based on a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) with a universal background model (UBM). Coupled parameter learning between the speaker models and UBM is utilized to improve performance. Finally, maximum, mean and weighted sum fusions of model scores are used to enhance the Speaker Identification Accuracy (SIA). Verifications conducted on the TIMIT database with and without noise confirm performance improvement.

AB  - Electrocardiogram is a widely used biosignal for diagnosis of pathological situation concerning heart function. Interpretation and analysis of this signal is critical for the selection of the appropriate treatment and this highlights the necessity for clean signals without any kind of artifacts. Several methods have been developed in order to remove artifacts and delineate the characteristics of the ECG that physicians need to evaluate. In this paper, Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) is considered and the application of the decomposition method in experimental signals acquired by means of a wireless sensor network is evaluated. The proposed technique is based on the EMD and is studied comparatively to classic techniques of signal processing. Certain metrics are implemented to evaluate the performance of the technique and the results show good results of the EMD based method.

AB  - A technique for identification of system dynamics under the influence of measurement noise is presented. When output signal from sensor is corrupted by noise, identification of system parameters become an arduous task. Therefore, denoising methods can be employed in order to achieve a clean limit cycle under noisy environment. A Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) method has been reported as an effective technique for the mitigation of noise by an appropriate thresholding. Generalized explicit expressions are examined to obtain unknown plant model parameters for stable and unstable First Order Plus Dead Time (FOPDT) processes. Examples are illustrated to show the effectiveness of method during parametric identification of process models. Subsequently, a comparison is drawn between estimated and actual system through simulation by step test and Nyquist plot.

AB  - Optoelectronic oscillators (OEOs) with their demonstrated low phase noise are popular due to the increasing demand of very clean local oscillator and clock signal sources. A forced technique of self-injection locked and phase-locked loop (SILPLL) reduces phase noise and suppresses side mode observed in long fiber delay of the standard OEO. A frequency synthesizer working at X-band is developed using an electrically coarse-tuned YIG filter cascaded with an optical wavelength fine-tuned dispersive optical transversal filter by tuning the oscillation frequency of the synthesized OEO frequency, as a replacement for fixed-frequency narrowband filter using high-Q aluminum cavities. A close-to-carrier phase noise of -115 dBc/Hz at 1 kHz is reported by the Vπ/2 operation of a Mach-Zehnder modulator (MZM) over 8-12 GHz with a frequency tuning step as small as 2.6 kHz. Phase noise introduced by a photodetector is also explored at a very close-to-carrier frequency. It shows 10-dB phase noise degradation at PD reverse bias voltage of 3 V compared with 6 V at close to the Vπ operation of an MZM. A 19-in rack mount frequency synthesizer system is also realized at X-band with a demonstrated long-term (up to 60 min) frequency drift stability of 3 kHz over whole X-band working frequencies.

AB  - With the continuous improvement of information and communication technology, the popularity of mobile terminals and endless new technologies, the application of mobile Internet is increasingly extensive. This paper mainly studies the multi-source data analysis method based on mobile Internet. Through the connection of multi-source database, the data is associated and the foundation of data fusion is constructed. It is stored in the specified storage database or data medium according to certain rules. On this basis, first of all, preprocess the data, sort out and correct those disordered storage formats, disordered data records and redundant fields to form standard data. Secondly, these data are cleaned to remove data redundancy and noise. Through the combination of multi-source data, new data records are obtained, and these data are sorted and improved. According to the actual situation and problems of the project, the multi-source data is fused to build an effective data set. Data show that the accuracy of the model can reach more than 85%. The results show that mobile Internet technology can provide security and risk information for the participants of the exhibition.

AB  - We present a method for removing environmental noise from physiological recordings such as magnetoencephalography (MEG) for which noise-sensitive reference channels are available. Sensor signals are projected on a subspace spanned by the reference channels augmented by time-shifted and/or nonlinearly transformed versions of the same, and the projections are removed to obtain "clean" sensor signals. The method compensates for scalar, convolutional or non-linear mismatches between sensor and reference channels by synthesizing, for each reference/sensor pair, a filter that is optimal in a least-squares sense for removal of the artifact. The method was tested with synthetic and real MEG data, typically removing up to 98% of noise variance. It offers an alternative to bulky and costly magnetic shielding (multiple layers of aluminium and mu-metal) for present scientific and medical applications and future developments such as brain-machine interfaces (BMI).

AB  - Surveillance footage pose particular difficulties in terms of low-quality either in resolution due to high compression or sensor inconsistency. Latter ones could generate several types of noises such as salt and pepper noises. In this article we apply and evaluate an innovative method for salt and pepper noise removal on surveillance images. The method combines synergy of neural networks, evolutive and statistical methods. The Pulse Coupled Neural Network (PCNN) is used to detect the pixels affected by noise whose parameters have been optimized using a Genetic Algorithm. The pixels that are affected by noise are corrected using a Gaussian Kernel. The proposed method proves to be high efficient o n detecting a nd removing s alt a nd pepper noise from images without affecting surrounding clean pixels. The method has been tested on images from real-world CCTV cameras. The examples from Scotland Yard database show how the filtered images with o ur proposed method retain fine details of the scene even if the noise level was high.

AB  - Multispectral satellite imaging sensors acquire various spectral band images and have a unique spectroscopic property in each band. Unfortunately, image artifacts from imaging sensor noise often affect the quality of scenes and have a negative impact on applications for satellite imagery. Recently, deep learning approaches have been extensively explored to remove noise in satellite imagery. Most deep learning denoising methods, however, follow a supervised learning scheme, which requires matched noisy image and clean image pairs that are difficult to collect in real situations. In this article, we propose a novel unsupervised multispectral denoising method for satellite imagery using a wavelet directional cycle-consistent adversarial network (WavCycleGAN). The proposed method is based on an unsupervised learning scheme using adversarial loss and cycle-consistency loss to overcome the lack of paired data. Moreover, in contrast to the standard image-domain cycleGAN, we introduce a wavelet directional learning scheme for effective denoising without sacrificing high-frequency components such as edges and detailed information. Experimental results for the removal of vertical stripes and wave noise in satellite imaging sensors demonstrate that the proposed method effectively removes noise and preserves important high-frequency features of satellite images.

AB  - This work develops an application-aware approach to signal de-noising. The approach considers the way in which a signal from a sensor or receiver is processed and used in deciding how best to de-noise the signal. The benefits of the system-wide approach are illustrated through an application that processes raw indirect position feedback signals in a switched reluctance motor (SRM) drive. The results show that the application-aware de-noising scheme results in more noise reduction than can be obtained using a more conventional approach. The approach delivered a clean and useful estimated rotor position for the SRM that improved its output performance.

AB  - Data acquired across sensors may contain irrelevant components such as interference and noise. A distributed framework is put forth that enables sensors to extract the `clean' portion of a data sequence and isolate the corrupted data. Different from outliers, the corrupted data may affect an arbitrary in size portion of the data sequence. The clean informative data usually consist of low-dimensional components giving rise to a low-rank data covariance matrix, while the presence of irrelevant data increases the rank. This property leads to a novel constrained minimization formulation that combines low-rank matrix decomposition and data selection. A separable formulation is further derived which is tackled via coordinate descent techniques and the alternating direction method of multipliers. Numerical tests demonstrate the potential of the novel distributed scheme.

AB  - Driver behavior detection is one of the most important approaches for reducing road traffic accidents because most of the road traffic accidents are caused by the fault of drivers. Nevertheless, current weather conditions and important places where driver reach also play major role for detecting driver's behavior. In this research work, driver's current latitude and longitude positions and time are collected using smart phones. And then, noise and stop GPS points are removed. After that, some GPS missing points are found and they are estimated by interpolation method. After all, a cleaned trajectory is achieved. Driver's current driving speed, acceleration and deceleration are calculated from the collected GPS trajectory and time, and the current speed is compared with the road speed limit. Driver's current driving direction is detected based on the cleaned trajectory. In this research work, in order to detect driver's real-time driving behavior more precisely, road speed limit data is enriched by the current weather condition, light condition and the current important places that the driver is passing through.

AB  - The rapid advancement of IoT technologies has led to its flexible adoption in battle field networks, known as Internet of Battlefield Things (IoBT) networks. One important application of IoBT networks is the weather sensory network characterized with a variety of weather, land and environmental sensors. This data contains hidden trends and correlations, needed to provide situational awareness to soldiers and commanders. To interpret the incoming data in real-time, machine learning algorithms are required to automate strategic decision-making. Existing solutions are not well-equipped to provide the fine-grained feedback to military personnel and cannot facilitate a scalable, end-to-end platform for fast unlabeled data collection, cleaning, querying, analysis and threats identification. In this work, we present a scalable end-to-end IoBT data driven platform for SVAD (Storage, Visualization, Anomaly Detection) analysis of heterogeneous weather sensor data. Our SVAD platform includes extensive data cleaning techniques to denoise efficiently data to differentiate data from anomalies and noise data instances. We perform comparative analysis of unsupervised machine learning algorithms for multi-variant data analysis and experimental evaluation of different data ingestion pipelines to show the ability of the SVAD platform for (near) real-time processing. Our results indicate impending turbulent weather conditions that can be detected by early anomaly identification and detection techniques.

AB  - In home environments, demands for a robot to serve a user are on the increase, such as cleaning rooms, bringing something to the user, and so on. To achieve these tasks, it is essential for developing a natural way of human-robot interaction (HRI). One of the most natural ways is that the robot approaches the user to do some tasks after recognizing the user's call and localizing its position. In this case, user localization becomes a key technology. In this paper, we propose a novel audio visual user localization system. It consists of a microphone array with eight sensors and a video camera. Estimating calling direction is achieved by the spectral subtraction of the spatial spectra. In particular, a novel beam forming method is proposed to suppress the nonstationary audio noises where they always occur in a real world. Furthermore, a robust method for face detection is proposed to double check the user based on an Adaboost classifier. It is improved to reduce the false alarms remarkably through a new postprocessing on face candidates. Successful results in a real home environment show its efficacy and feasibility. The implementation issues, limitations, and their possible solutions are also discussed.

AB  - We have developed a motion and noise artifact (MNA)-resilient atrial fibrillation (AF) detection algorithm for smartphones that eliminates MNAs, and then detects AFs in smartphone camera recordings. MNA-corrupted episodes are observed to have larger values of turning point ratio (TPR), pulse slope, or Kurtosis compared to clean AF and normal sinus rhythm (NSR) episodes. On the other hand, AFs are shown to have larger root mean square of successive RR differences (RMSSD) and Shannon Entropy (ShE) [1]. Our developed AF algorithm is capable of separating MNAs, NSRs, AFs, which enhances the specificity of AF detection. We have recruited 88 subjects having AF at baseline and NSR after electrical cardioversion, and 11 subjects having MNA-corrupted NSRs to evaluate the performance of our AF algorithm. The clinical tests show that the proposed AF algorithm gives higher accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of 0.9667, 0.9765, 0.9714 compared to the previous AF algorithm [1].

AB  - For affordable cardiac health monitoring, it is required to ensure accurate cardiac condition detection from smartphone or wearable-extracted photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals through precise identification, and removal of signal corruption. Presence of noise particularly due to motion artifacts strongly impacts the outcome of analysis. We establish that denoising of PPG signal would pave ways for better clinical prediction than analyzing the signal in presence of noise. In this paper, we prove that analyzing on cleaned (denoised) PPG signal yields significant performance efficacy improvement while performing Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) identification. The proposed method is independent on the clinical analytics and CAD detection is considered to be a use case to justify our claim that physiological signal pre-processing, specifically denoising can substantially improve the overall performance effectiveness and clinical utility.

AB  - High input impedance, low noise, high common mode rejection ratio (CMRR), and ultralow power are the most important performance indicators in the design of analog front end (AFE) for wearable biomedical sensors. This paper presents a fully differential difference amplifier based AFE that employs dc-coupled input stage to increase the input impedance and improve CMRR. A parasitic capacitor reuse technique is proposed to improve the noise/area efficiency and CMRR. An on-body dc bias scheme is introduced to deal with the input dc offset. Implemented in 0.35 μm CMOS process with an area of 0.405 mm2, the proposed AFE consumes 0.9 μW at 1.8 V and shows excellent noise effective factor of 2.55, and CMRR of 76 dB. Experiment shows the proposed AFE not only picks up clean ECG signal with electrodes placed as close as 2 cm under both resting and walking conditions, but also obtain the distinct α-wave after eye blink from EEG recording.

AB  - Denoising of hyperspectral images in the domain of imaging spectroscopy by vectorial anisotropic diffusion is addressed. Anisotropic diffusion has shown to be a powerful denoising technique with many applications in several fields of image processing, and in the recent years, some significant advances have been published. However, these had not yet been specifically adapted to hyperspectral imagery. This paper reviews recent advances in anisotropic diffusion for multivalued images, analyzes their application to hyperspectral images, and proposes a new diffusion method which takes advantage of the recent improvements and conforms to the specificities of hyperspectral remote sensing. Some examples are provided using both a noisy image and a clean image with added noise

AB  - Measurement of the geomagnetic field provides a reliable and economical basis for determining the attitude of low-Earth orbiting three-axis stabilized spacecraft. Magnetometers are often part of the momentum management system, working in parallel with the onboard attitude control system (ACS). They may also be used as primary ACS sensors for missions with relatively coarse pointing requirements or for acquisition or contingency control modes on fine-pointing star tracker-based missions. When used in combination with strap-down gyroscopes for rate determination, magnetometer data can be filtered to obtain surprisingly accurate attitude estimates. The attainable accuracy depends on the specifics of the gyroscope quality, prior magnetometer calibration, the length of the data set, and to a lesser extent, the orbital details. It has been found, though, that even with very clean sensor data the magnetometer residuals still show systematic variations arising from small errors in the reference Earth magnetic field model. Two filters have been developed to estimate and compensate for the reference field errors along with the attitude and gyroscope biases. The field errors are modeled as sequentially correlated random variables. In the first filter, the autocorrelation of the error is assumed to decay exponentially in time. In the second, the autocorrelation is a decaying sinusoid. The resulting attitude estimates are improved by 40 percent (to 126 arcsec) and the bias estimates by a factor of two. With these improvements, autonomous onboard attitude control using magnetometers and gyroscopes becomes practical for a much broader class of missions.

AB  - Stripe and random noise are two different degradation phenomena that commonly coexist in optical remote sensing images, and they are often modeled as inverse problems. In model-based inverse problems, analysis and synthesis sparse representations (SSRs) are used as regularization terms to obtain approximate solutions due to their respective merits, i.e., the nonzero coefficients in SSR are usually used to describe an image, while the indexes of zeros in analysis sparse representation (ASR) are used to characterize the stripe. Inspired by these merits, we propose a unified variational framework, called a joint analysis and weighted synthesis (JAWS) sparsity model, to simultaneously separate the clean image and the stripe from a single optical remote sensing image. To solve the JAWS sparsity model efficiently, an alternating minimization optimization strategy is first employed to separate it into two subproblems that are used for different tasks. One called as weighted SSR (WSSR) is the main for optical remote sensing image denoising, which can be effectively solved by employing the weighted singular value thresholding operator, while the other called as ASR is the main approach for optical remote sensing image destriping, which is optimized by adopting the split Bregman iteration. By minimizing the two subproblems alternatively, the proposed JAWS sparsity model is efficiently solved. Finally, both quantitative and qualitative results of experiments on synthetic and real-world optical remote sensing images validate that the proposed approach is effective and even better than the state of the arts.

AB  - Joint processing of throat and acoustic microphone recordings has been an attractive tool for robust speech processing. As the throat microphones record the acoustic sounds in the form of vibrations from skin attached sensors, they are more robust and highly correlated with the acoustic speech signal. We investigate the correlation of throat and acoustic microphone recordings. We propose a hidden Markov model (HMM) based structure to estimate acoustic speech features from throat speech features. The HMM based estimator will be used to estimate clean acoustic speech features from noisy throat and acoustic microphone recordings. Experimental results on acoustic speech feature estimation are provided.

AB  - The filtering parameters of non-local means (NLM) that seriously affect the denoising results are usually optimized based on the noise level estimation. But the noise level is unknown in many cases. In this paper, a simple method for optimizing NLM parameters based on autocorrelation function (ACF) is proposed from the perspective of signal estimation, which uses the periodic lag of the autocorrelation function to estimate the vibration signal. This method is verified with a hypothetical clean image corrupted by additive noise, and the NLM parameter optimization results are compared with those obtained by two traditional methods based on peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity (SSIM) respectively. Then it is tested with the practical vibration signal of a phase-sensitive optical time-domain reflectometer ($\varphi$-OTDR). The fidelity and spatial resolution of the denoised practical signal are analyzed. This work helps to improve the performance of $\varphi$-OTDR and signal recognition.

AB  - The estimation of source and environmental parameters for stationary broadband wave propagation in an unknown shallow ocean is considered. We apply an approximate maximum-likelihood technique (AMLE) in the frequency domain after cleaning the observations from outliers using robust prewhitening. This method is compared with the previously used multitaper techniques. Environmental noise in data obtained by horizontally towed arrays just beneath the ocean surface has been observed to be more spiky than Gaussian due to the sound originating from individual breaking waves. Therefore, we apply the robust-resistant spectral methods introduced by Martin and Thomson (1982). The advantage of this approach is the physically and statistically justified full broadband estimator. Simulations show the feasibility of the presented approach. Finally, the algorithm is applied to real sonar data recorded by a horizontally towed receiver array in the Baltic Sea in order to estimate the ocean depth and source bearings and to interpret the impinging signals.

AB  - A very clean and low phase noise microwave oscillator is required for communication and high resolution imaging. A frequency stabilized and tunable opto-electronic oscillator (OEO) is realized as synthesizer using a long fiber optic delay line combined with a tunable narrowband microwave filter. Forced oscillation using both self-injection locking and self-phase lock loop, as SILPLL provides an ultra-low close-in and far away from carrier phase noise to achieve a record low phase noise. A YIG microwave filter combined with an optically tuned transversal filter is employed to implement frequency tuned OEO to realize highly stable synthesizer in X-band. Phase noise - 136dBc/Hz at offset frequency 10kHz is achieved for 9GHZ to 11GHz. Moreover, a synthesizer for K-band is demonstrated by adjusting the operation point of a dual drive MZM (DD-MZM) from quadrature point of Vpi/2 to Vpi, where the second harmonic in addition to fundamental is efficiently generated with -127dBc/Hz phase noise at offset frequency 10kHz for 18-22GHz.

The raw BCG signal is so weak and often involves a lot of noise that some device should be designed to extract a clean BCG signal. According to the characteristics of BCG signal, a new insusceptibility detection and processing system of the BCG signal based on CPLD (Complex Programmable Logic Device) is presented in this paper, which can acquire BCG signal from resistance strain weighing sensors mounted on the chair designed to look like a normal home chair without attaching any electrodes to the subject. The system is composed of two modules, signal processing module and signal acquisition module, which can obtain clean BCG signal synchronously with cardiac cycles for long time in practice, shows that the design is reasonable.

AB  - Domestic service robots such as lawn mowing and vacuum cleaning robots are the most numerous consumer robots in existence today. While early versions employed random exploration, recent systems fielded by most of the major manufacturers have utilized range-based and visual sensors and user-placed beacons to enable robots to map and localize. However, active range and visual sensing solutions have the disadvantages of being intrusive, expensive, or only providing a 1D scan of the environment, while the requirement for beacon placement imposes other practical limitations. In this paper we present a passive and potentially cheap vision-based solution to 2D localization at night that combines easily obtainable day-time maps with low resolution contrast-normalized image matching algorithms, image sequence-based matching in two-dimensions, place match interpolation and recent advances in conventional low light camera technology. In a range of experiments over a domestic lawn and in a lounge room, we demonstrate that the proposed approach enables 2D localization at night, and analyse the effect on performance of varying odometry noise levels, place match interpolation and sequence matching length. Finally we benchmark the new low light camera technology and show how it can enable robust place recognition even in an environment lit only by a moonless sky, raising the tantalizing possibility of being able to apply all conventional vision algorithms, even in the darkest of nights.

AB  - The prevalence of mobile sensors makes it possible for researchers to collect and analyze the pervasive sensed human activity data with machine learning tools. These analyses and applications heavily rely on the self-report survey data that reflect human physical and psychological behaviors. However, many factors can affect the reliability of such self-report surveys, such as participants' trusty and ambiguous descriptions in questionnaires. These inaccurate survey labels challenge the development of the models, especially when it comes to the case where deep learning approaches tend to memorize the noisy information from training data. In this paper, we set out to deal with the noisy self-report survey labels. We aim to address the following challenges: 1)the limited access to clean labeled data in real-world scenarios; 2)different noise ratio of the data from different participants; 3)various types of noise that appear in the data; 4)how to evaluate the reliability of participants. As such, we propose a generalizable model, Lan, for learning from multi-modal sensory data and noisy labels. The proposed model incorporates the temporal information from sensory data to guide the model training and thus to augment noise tolerance. Extensive experiments on a real-world dataset were conducted to show our model outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks.

AB  - Recently, deep learning-based methods are proposed for hyperspectral images (HSIs) denoising. Among them, unsupervised methods such as deep image prior (DIP)-based methods have received much attention because these methods do not require any training data. However, DIP-based methods suffer from the semiconvergence behavior, i.e., the iteration of DIP-based methods needs to terminate by referring to the ground-truth image at the optimal iteration point. In this article, we propose the spatial-spectral constrained deep image prior (S2DIP) for the HSI mixed noise removal. Specifically, we integrate the DIP, the spatial-spectral total variation regularization term, and the $\ell _1$-norm sparse term to respectively capture the deep prior of the clean HSI, the spatial-spectral local smooth prior of the clean HSI, and the sparse prior of noise. The proposed S2DIP jointly leverages the expressive power brought from the deep convolutional neural network without any training data and exploits the HSI and noise structures via hand-crafted priors. Thus, our method avoids the semiconvergence behavior of DIP-based methods. Meanwhile, our method largely enhances the HSI denoising ability of DIP-based methods. To tackle the corresponding model, we utilize the alternating direction multiplier method algorithm. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms model-based and deep learning-based state-of-the-art HSI denoising methods.

AB  - A low-complexity method for source enumeration is proposed in this letter. Given the training data of a desired signal, an array data matrix is partitioned into orthogonal signal and noise components. The noise components are then used to calculate the total description length required to encode the array data. The model with the minimum description length (MDL) is chosen as the best model. Unlike the traditional MDL methods, the proposed method linearly partitions the array data into the cleaner signal and noise components and thereby is more accurate and computationally efficient. Its performance is demonstrated via numerical results.

AB  - Remote sensing technology is an essential link in the global monitoring of the ocean surface, and radars are efficient sensors for detecting marine pollution. When used operationally by authorities, a tradeoff must usually be made between the covered area and the quantity of information collected by the radar. To identify the most appropriate imaging mode, a methodology based on receiver operating characteristic curve analysis has been applied to an original data set collected by two airborne systems operating at L-band, both characterized by a very low instrument noise floor. The data set was acquired during controlled releases of mineral and vegetable oil at sea. Various polarization-dependent quantities are investigated, and their ability to detect slick-covered areas is assessed. A relative ordering of the main polarimetric parameters is reported in this paper. When the sensor has a sufficiently low noise floor, HV is recommended because it provides the strongest slick-sea contrast. Otherwise, VV is found to be the most relevant parameter for detecting slicks on the ocean surface. Among all the investigated quad-polarimetric settings, no significant added value compared to single-polarized data was found. More specifically, it is demonstrated, by increasing the instrument noise level, that the studied polarimetric quantities which combine the four polarimetric channels have performances of detection mainly driven by the instrument noise floor, namely, the noise equivalent sigma zero. This result, obtained by progressively adding noise to the raw synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, indicates that the polarimetric discrimination between clean sea and polluted area results mainly from the differentiated behavior between single-bounce scattering and noise. It is thus demonstrated, using SAR data collected with a low instrument noise floor, that there is no deviation from Bragg scattering for radar scattering from ocean surface covered by mineral and vegetable oil.

AB  - In this paper, we propose a speech enhancement algorithm for estimating the clean speech using samples of air-conducted and bone-conducted speech signals. We introduce a model in a supervised learning framework by approximating a mapping from concatenation of noisy air-conducted and bone-conducted speech to clean speech in the short time Fourier transform domain. Two function extension schemes are utilized: geometric harmonics and Laplacian pyramid. Performances obtained from the two schemes are evaluated and compared in terms of spectrograms and log spectral distance measures.

AB  - Low-light images captured in the real world are inevitably corrupted by sensor noise. Such noise is spatially variant and highly dependent on the underlying pixel intensity, deviating from the oversimplified assumptions in conventional denoising. Existing light enhancement methods either overlook the important impact of real-world noise during enhancement, or treat noise removal as a separate pre- or post-processing step. We present Coordinated Enhancement for Real-world Low-light Noisy Images (CERL), that seamlessly integrates light enhancement and noise suppression parts into a unified and physics-grounded optimization framework. For the real low-light noise removal part, we customize a self-supervised denoising model that can easily be adapted without referring to clean ground-truth images. For the light enhancement part, we also improve the design of a state-of-the-art backbone. The two parts are then joint formulated into one principled plug-and-play optimization. Our approach is compared against state-of-the-art low-light enhancement methods both qualitatively and quantitatively. Besides standard benchmarks, we further collect and test on a new realistic low-light mobile photography dataset (RLMP), whose mobile-captured photos display heavier realistic noise than those taken by high-quality cameras. CERL consistently produces the most visually pleasing and artifact-free results across all experiments. Our RLMP dataset and codes are available at: https://github.com/VITA-Group/CERL.

AB  - Recent research has shown Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) trained in a fully-supervised fashion achieve promising performance on extreme low-light image denoising task. However, a large amount of "noisy-clean" image pairs are required to train a network, which are difficult to obtain. In this paper, we propose a compact yet effective noise model to generate synthetic noisy images for training. Especially, we address the severe color distortion problem in low-light images by identifying a novel noise component, black calibration error, as its physical origin. We prove that a small error at the sensing stage will strongly affect the following in-camera signal processing (ISP) pipeline and eventually lead to color bias. Experiment results demonstrate that the proposed model is superior in preserving perceptual quality and achieves state-of-the-art performance among existing noise synthesis methods.

AB  - 3D points acquisitions based on robust sensors such as tactile or laser sensors are true alternatives to computer vision for 3D object recognition. In real life scenarios where robots are equipped with such sensors to acquire 3D data, only few points can be iteratively collected in a reasonable amount of time. However, existing Point-cloud classifiers are extremely sensitive to sparse points, missing parts and noise. To compensate for the sparsity of the data, some Reinforcement Learning (RL) based approaches have been proposed to learn a sparse yet efficient exploration of the target object regarding the 3D recognition objective. However, existing RL approaches only focus on classification performances to guide the training of the active acquisition-and-classification frameworks, and thus fail to dissociate poor exploration strategy (missing parts, noisy points) from actual classifier mistakes on proper data. In this study, we proposed a new RL framework that was rewarded regarding both the classification performances and the exploration quality. Our trained framework outperforms existing State-Of-The-Art models on 3D geometric objects classification. We further showed that our trained framework learnt to alternate between (1) a clean and broad exploration strategy, suitable for easily distinguishable categories, and (2) a specific local exploration strategy, facilitating the discrimination of similar categories.

AB  - Free-space dielectric properties measurements at 10 GHz with four pairs of low-cost printed Yagi-Uda antennas are proposed for detecting foreign material in unshelled peanuts, including sticks, peanut shells, peanut raisins, and stones. The four-element array design of the Yagi-Uda antenna allowed better averaging over the entire sample volume and improved the measurement resolution. The antenna gain is about 9.7 dBi. The beam width of each antenna is about 18° and 38° for the E-plane and H-plane at 3 dB, respectively. The attenuation and phase shift were measured for each pair of antennas by controlling automatically the microwave switches. Measurement repeatability of the system was confirmed by using different thicknesses of polyethylene dielectric slab samples. The standard deviation was less than 0.5 dB for the attenuation and less than 5.0° for phase measurements. Sensitivity of each antenna pair for unshelled peanuts and different foreign materials, each loaded in a small volume (4.4 cm × 4.4 cm × 12.1 cm), was tested by using a partitioned sample container. It was shown that a difference in attenuation was more than 1.5 dB for different types of foreign materials and also for unshelled peanut samples with a 1% moisture content difference. Prediction of moisture content in cleaned unshelled peanut samples agreed well with the standard oven-drying method (standard error of calibration = 0.51%). The dielectric properties of foreign materials mixed with cleaned unshelled peanut samples were measured through the attenuation and phase shift. The measurement repeatability of each antenna and all four pairs of antennas is presented.

AB  - Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) imagery for estimating ground movement, based on microwaves reflected off ground targets is gaining increasing importance in remote sensing. However, noise corrupts microwave reflections received at satellite and contaminates the signal's wrapped phase. We introduce Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to this problem domain and show the effectiveness of autoencoder CNN architectures to learn InSAR image denoising filters in the absence of clean ground truth images, and for artefact reduction in estimated coherence through intelligent preprocessing of training data. We compare our results with four established methods to illustrate superiority of proposed method.

AB  - An electromagnetic flowmeter (EMF) can be used to measure the speed of slurry fluid. In this paper, according to Maxwell's equations and the dB/dt vortex electric field, a step excitation scheme is proposed. The original excitation process of the primary excitation current rise time is divided into a two-step excitation process. Without increasing the excitation current rise time, the equivalent excitation frequency is increased by increasing the primary dB/dt. This method can enhance the EMF's ability to overcome slurry noise. The paper analyzes the design parameters of the step excitation scheme and designs the software and hardware. After that, the paper compares the step excitation scheme with the three-value rectangular wave excitation scheme based on wavelet transform signal processing. Experiments show that the step excitation EMF has a lower steady-state fluctuation rate when measuring mortar and has a stronger ability to overcome slurry noise. Additionally, the step excitation EMF and Yokogawa AXF 040G EMF are compared experimentally. Through flow calibration, clean water measurement, mortar measurement and dynamic response experiment, it is verified that the step excitation EMF has the ability to enhance the resistance to slurry noise at the same excitation frequency.

AB  - This paper studies body-conducted speech for noise robust speech processing purposes. As body-conducted speech is typically limited in bandwidth, signal processing is required to obtain a signal that is both high in quality and low in noise. We propose an algorithm that first equalizes the body-conducted speech using filters obtained from a pre-defined filter set and subsequently fuses this equalized signal with a noisy conventional microphone signal using an optimal clean speech amplitude and phase estimator. We evaluated the proposed equalization and fusion technique using a combination of a conventional close-talk and a throat microphone. Subjective listening tests show that the proposed method successfully fuses the speech quality of the conventional signal and the noise robustness of the throat microphone signal. The listening tests also indicate that the inclusion of the body-conducted signal can improve single-channel speech enhancement methods, while a calculated set of objective signal quality measures confirm these observations.

AB  - The advancement in smart materials allows researchers to seek smart textiles for wearable health monitoring. Here, a washable and flexible textile-based dry electroencephalography (EEG) electrode that can detect brain activities has been developed. The EEG electrodes were constructed from an electrically conductive cotton fabric with  $67.23~\Omega $ /sq produced through printing PEDOT:PSS/PDMS conductive polymer composite on cotton fabric via screen printing. The mechanical properties like flexural rigidity and tensile strength of the conductive fabric were compared against the bare base material and a PEDOT:PSS-printed fabric. The result from an SEM revealed a uniform printing of the PEDOT:PSS/PDMS on the fabric. The signal-to-noise ratio of the textrode was higher than the Ag/AgCl dry electrode i.e. 17.32 (+3.1%) which open the door for long-term EEG monitoring. Moreover, the electrode can give clear and reliable EEG signals up to 15 washing cycles, 60 bending cycles, 5 multiple uses, and 8 hours of continued use.

AB  - General equations for the identification of stable and unstable second order plus dead time (SOPDT) processes are proposed in this paper. During feedback test, a nonlinear device (relay) is connected to process with a phase lag of n radians yielding sustained oscillations known as limit cycle. With the help of describing function (DF) approximation, equivalent gain of an asymmetrical relay is derived and thereafter used in the derivation of mathematical equations for the identification of process dynamics. When a process output is subjected to measurement noise, relay output shows spurious switching which brings chattering in the limit cycle output. In order to retrieve a clean limit cycle output, Fourier series based curve fitting method is implemented. Using frequency response plots, the efficacy of the proposed methodology is drawn through comparisons between actual and estimated process models.

AB  - Despite much advance obtained in hyperspectral image sensors, they are still very sensitive to the noise, and thus cause the captured data to carry enough noise to degrade the classification results. The traditional approach first resorts to image denoising and then feeds the denoised image into a classifier. However, such a straightforward approach, treating denoising and classification separately, suffers greatly from neglecting their impacts on each other. This paper presents a new simultaneous denoising and classification method in the pursuit of cleanest image for optimal classification in the sense of given task evaluation measures. To obtain this objective, we develop a hybrid conditional random field (CRF) (for denoising) and multinomial logistic regression (MLR) (for classification) model at first, and then to train the proposed hybrid model, we propose a new joint learning method, which can effectively capture the impacts of denoising on classification, or vice versa, the effects of classification on denoising. Through the proposed joint learning method, the CRF and MLR, and thus the denoising and classification procedure, can be tightly combined. Moreover, the proposed joint learning method can directly optimize a large class of application specific performance measures including both the linear measures, such as the overall accuracy, and the nonlinear measures, such as kappa statistics. Meanwhile, the consistency between the criteria of model learning and model application has the potential to obtain the denoised image, which is at its best for optimal classification in the sense of the given measure. The extensive experiments of simultaneous denoising and classification tasks are conducted in both simulated and real noisy conditions to test our jointly learned model, which are shown to outperform the conventional methods of treating the two tasks independently.

AB  - The fabrication of 3D detectors which requires bulk micromachining of columnar electrodes has been realized with advancements in MEMS technology. Since the fabrication of the first 3D prototype in Stanford Nanofabrication Facility in 1997, a significant effort has been put forth to transfer the 3D detector technology to large scale manufacturing for future high luminosity collider experiments, in which the radiation hardness will be the primary concern, and other applications such as medical imaging and X-ray imaging for molecular biology. First, alternative 3D structures, single type column (STC) and double-side double type column (DDTC) 3D detectors, were produced at FBK-irst (Trento, Italy) and CNM-Barcelona (Spain), and assessed thoroughly to improve the production technology towards the standard full-3D detectors. The 3D collaboration has been extended to include SINTEF (Norway), which is committed to small to medium scale production of active edge full-3D silicon sensors. This paper focuses on p-type 3D detectors compatible with the CMS pixel front end electronics from the second run of fabrication at SINTEF clean room facilities. The sensors that passed the wafer level electrical characterization have been bump-bonded at IZM (Germany), assembled into modules and wire-bonded for functional characterization at Purdue University. We report the leakage current characteristics, bump-bond quality, threshold, noise, and gain measurement results of these 3D modules as well as the preliminary beam test data taken at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory.

AB  - In this paper, a personal digital assistant (PDA) for hands-free speech recognition and communication with a microphone array mounted on the PDA is presented. An outlier-robust generalized sidelobe canceller (RGSC) and a minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) estimator for log Mel-spectral energy coefficients using a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) for clean speech are implemented in real-time and evaluated for speech recognition based on a small experimental multichannel database. It is shown that the joint system of beamformer and single-channel noise suppression highly improves the noise-robustness of a large-vocabulary speech recognizer so that down to SNR = 5 dB more than 91% word accuracy is obtained

AB  - In environments of strong background noise and reverberations, enhancement performance of classic microphone array enhancement systems is still not enough. Since ICA (independent component analysis) can separate independent sources only from observations, in this paper ICA is applied to highly noisy sensor signals to obtain cleaner speech signals, which are taken as inputs to the following microphone array enhancement systems. Experiments on real data show that the procedure of ICA preprocessing is effective in suppressing ambient noise, and dramatically improving the quality of input signals. Performance of microphone array speech enhancement system combining ICA preprocessing is greatly promoted.

AB  - According to the prior knowledge used in the algorithms, NMF-based speech enhancement can be categorized into supervised (NMF) one and semi-supervised (SNMF) one. In the supervised version, speech is estimated with the prior knowledge of both speech and noise. For the semi-supervised version, speech bases are learned on clean speech data in advance and adapted to different noise conditions. With the probabilistic estimation of whether the speech is present or not in a certain frame, this paper presents an extension to both NMF- and SNMF-based speech enhancement techniques by incorporating the speech presence probability (SPP) into their multiplicative update process. The performance of the algorithms is evaluated on three metrics (PESQ, LSD and SDR) by making experiments on TIMIT with 20 noise types at various signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) levels. All the proposed algorithms show the superiority over the conventional NMF, SNMF-based speech enhancement techniques, and also obtain better performance than some unsupervised state-of-the-art algorithms.

AB  - Real world signals are afflicted by noise, be it the communication signals or the remote sensor signals including the medical imaging sensors or surveillance sensors. In the case of signals from SAR(Synthetic Aperture Radar) sensor from remote sensing platforms, or USG or MRI from medical images, the noise is multiplicative. The coherent nature of the signal processing involved in the data generation for the latter, gives rise to a g rainy kind of signal dependent noise called speckle. Speckle noise affects the radiometric quality of the image and makes data interpretation and analysis difficult. Since the utility of any data depends on the accuracy of the data both in terms of geometry and radiometry, denoising becomes mandatory for image analysis applications. The common problem with most of these denoising filters is that they blur the images while reducing the noise. The challenge thus, lies in cleaning the image without sacrificing the geometric resolution. Wavelet based filtering techniques show promising results in this regard. In this paper the results and analysis of performing filtering on high resolution SAR data, using different mother wavelets of Daubechie's using soft thresholding technique, are presented.

AB  - We demonstrate that the performance of NbN lattice cooled hot electron bolometer mixers depends strongly on the interface quality between the bolometer and the contact structure. Both the receiver noise temperature and the gain bandwidth can be improved by a factor of 2 by cleaning the interface and adding an additional superconducting interlayer to the contact pad. Using this we obtain a double sideband receiver noise temperature of 950 K at 2.5 THz and 4.3 K, using a 0.4/spl times/4 /spl mu/m HEB mixer with a spiral antenna. At the same bias point, we obtain an IF gain bandwidth of 6 GHz. To comply with current demands on THz mixers for use in space based receivers we reduce the device size to 0.15/spl times/1 /spl mu/m and use a twin slot antenna. We report measurements of the noise temperature, LO power requirement, stability and the direct detection effect, using a mixer with a 1.6 THz twin slot antenna and a 1.462 THz solid state LO source with calibrated output power.

AB  - Reduced rank linear predictive frequency and direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation algorithms use the singular value decomposition (SVD) to produce a noise-cleaned linear prediction vector. These algorithms then root this vector to obtain a subset of roots, whose angles contain the desired frequency or DOA information. The roots closest to the unit circle are deemed to be the "signal roots". The rest of the roots are "extraneous". The extraneous roots are expensive to calculate. Further, a search must be done to discern the signal roots from the extraneous roots. Here, we present a reduced polynomial order linear prediction method that simplifies the rooting computation for applications where high-speed processing is critical.

AB  - Data pre-processing in smart manufacturing scenarios implies that data engineers must have knowledge of many different techniques necessary for example to clean, segment, normalize and to efficiently store time-series data. However, for many data engineers often results difficult to be aware of the most adequate pre-processing techniques due to the heterogeneous time-series data they must deal with and the variety of existing techniques.In this paper, a visual-interactive web system that facilitates the pre-processing task to data engineers is presented. On the one hand, data engineers can use it to select an adequate technology for detecting and handling outliers, to remove noise and to impute missing values in time series. Moreover, the system provides some recommendations to select the appropriate techniques and parameter values required by them. On the other hand, the system includes a machine learning module that suggests the most appropriate reduced representations in order to efficiently store those time series. The system has been tested with real time series of two different manufacturing companies.

AB  - In this paper, we have proposed a low complexity architecture of the Single Channel Independent Component Analysis Algorithm (SCICA) targeted for remote cardiac health monitoring by introducing the concept of coordinate rotation. The ECG is widely used for the diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases, and in remote healthcare applications, it is necessary to obtain clean ECG data by separating noise from the obtained signal. Independent Component Analysis is popularly used to solve the signal separation problem, however it requires as many signal sensors as the number of independent signals involved, and also requires the number of signals involved to be known a priori. This is not always possible in remote healthcare environments and thus, this motivates us to explore the use of the SCICA algorithm which requires only one input sensor for signal separation. SCICA is computationally intensive and thus there is a need for a low-complexity implementation of the algorithm for the development of healthcare devices. The proposed architecture is validated in terms of functionality and computational complexity and it has been observed that its performance compares favorably with the conventional algorithm.

AB  - Wearable device usage is burgeoning, with representative applications ranging from patient/athelete monitoring to stress/fatigue identification to the so-called quantified self movement. Typically, cardiac information is monitored via electrocardiograms (ECG) and information such as heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) are used as key health-related metrics. With many wearable devices, however, lower quality sensors are used, thus resulting in devices that are highly sensible to artifacts due to e.g., user's movement. The introduced artifacts hamper HR/HRV analyses, thus ECG enhancement has been the focus of recent research. Existing enhancement algorithms, however, do not perform well in very noisy conditions, as well as add additional computational processing to already battery-hungry wearable applications. Here, we propose to overcome these limitations by describing a new ECG signal representation called the modulation spectrum. By quantifying the rate-of-change of ECG spectral components, signal and artifactual components become separable, thus allowing for accurate HR and HRV measurement from the noisy signal, even in very extreme conditions typically seen in athletic performance training. The proposed MD-HRV (modulation-domain HRV) metric is tested with noise-corrupted synthetic ECG signals and is compared to `true' HRV values obtained from the clean signals. Experimental results show the proposed metric significantly outperforming conventional HRV indices computed on both the noisy, as well as enhanced ECG signals processed by a state-of-the-art wavelet-based algorithm. The obtained findings suggest that the proposed metric is well suited for wearable applications, particularly those involved with intense movement (e.g., in elite athletic training).

AB  - Radio interferometry usually compensates for high levels of noise in sensor/antenna electronics by throwing data and energy at the problem: observe longer, then store and process it all. Furthermore, only the end image is cleaned, reducing flexibility substantially. We propose instead a method to remove the noise explicitly before imaging. To this end, we developed an algorithm that first decomposes the sensor signals into components using Singular Spectrum Analysis and then cluster these components using graph Laplacian matrix. We show through simulation the potential for radio astronomy, in particular, illustrating the benefit for LOFAR, the low frequency array in Netherlands. From telescopic data to least-squares image estimates, far higher accuracy with low computation cost results without the need for long observation time.

AB  - Remote sensing technology is an essential link in the global monitoring of the ocean surface and radars are efficient sensors for detecting marine pollution. When used operationally, a tradeoff must usually be made between the covered area and the quantity of information collected by the radar. To identify the most appropriate imaging mode, a methodology based on Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis has been applied to an original dataset collected by an airborne system, SETHI, characterized by a very low instrument noise floor. The dataset was acquired during an oil spill clean-up exercise carried out in 2015 in the North Sea. Various polarization-dependent quantities are investigated and a relative ordering of the main polarimetric parameters is reported. VV offers the best tradeoff between the benefit of detection performance and the instrument and data requirements. When the sensor has a sufficiently low noise floor, HV is also recommended because it provides strong slick-sea contrast. Among all the investigated quad-polarimetric settings, no significant added value compared to single-polarized data was found.

AB  - Partial discharge (PD) can be used to predict insulation failures in power transformers. Accurate detection of particular PD types has a significant role in anticipating forthcoming outages. However, the noise encountered with PD measurements negatively affects the detection accuracy. In this paper, we propose a robust PD detection technique that is immune to noise through efficient frequency domain-based feature extraction from acoustic emission signals. The PD spectrum is first obtained using Fourier transform and then, the low frequency band of 0.05–0.15MHz is used as a representative feature vector. Finally, four different classifiers are used to examine the PD detection accuracy. Experimental results on a benchmark dataset verify the robustness of the proposed method for PD detection, as it achieves 100% classification accuracy for clean PD signals and up to 99.62% for noisy PD signals.

AB  - Construction simulation is used to analyze uncertainties inherent to project activities and variations in work packages. However, existing simulation systems often fail to meaningfully contribute to the decision-making process due to their inability to evolve with changing project conditions. Equipping simulation models with sensing and reality capture technologies has been investigated as possible remedies to this problem. This, however, requires meticulous effort to procure, set up, operate, synchronize, and calibrate peripheral devices for data collection, transmission, and mining. Furthermore, sensor readings are often noisy and imperfect. The chaos theory explains how small variations in sensor readings used as simulation model input can lead to relatively large volatility in the output even in simple linear systems. This paper investigates a scientific methodology for generating more stable simulation models using an evolutionary algorithm that produces clean datasets by processing and significantly reducing noise in imperfect data obtained from consumer-grade sensors.

AB  - In low light conditions, visible (VIS) images are of a low dynamic range (low contrast) with severe noise and color, while near-infrared (NIR) images contain clear textures without noise and color. Multispectral fusion of VIS and NIR images produces color images of high quality, rich textures, and little noise by taking both advantages of VIS and NIR images. In this article, we propose the deep selective fusion of VIS and NIR images using unsupervised U-Net. Existing image fusion methods are afflicted with the low contrast in VIS images and flash-like effect in NIR images. Thus, we adopt unsupervised U-Net to achieve deep selective fusion of multiple scale features. Due to the absence of the ground truth, we use unsupervised learning by formulating an energy function as a loss function. To deal with insufficient training data, we perform data augmentation by rotating images and adjusting their intensity. We synthesize training data by degrading clean VIS images and masking clean NIR images using a circle. First, we utilize pretrained visual geometry group (VGG) to extract features from VIS images. Second, we build an encoding network to obtain edge information from NIR images. Finally, we combine all features and feed them into a decoding network for fusion. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed fusion network produces visually pleasing results with fine details, little noise, and natural color and it is superior to state-of-the-art methods in terms of visual quality and quantitative measurements.

AB  - We demonstrate an improvement in the state-of-the-art large vocabulary continuous speech recognition (LVCSR) performance, under clean and noisy conditions, by the use of visual information, in addition to the traditional audio one. We take a decision fusion approach for the audio-visual information, where the single-modality (audio- and visual- only) HMM classifiers are combined to recognize audio-visual speech. More specifically, we tackle the problem of estimating the appropriate combination weights for each of the modalities. Two different techniques are described: the first uses an automatically extracted estimate of the audio stream reliability in order to modify the weights for each modality (both clean and noisy audio results are reported), while the second is a discriminative model combination approach where weights on pre-defined model classes are optimized to minimize WER (clean audio only results).

AB  - This paper presents three different applications of median filters in power electronic systems, specifically, in traction motor drives. While median filters are commonly used in signal processing, literature regarding their utilization in power electronics is very limited. The theory behind median filters is first introduced and then three example applications are discussed: speed estimation for an induction motor drive, current sensing in a three-phase inverter, and dc bus voltage sensing in a half-bridge inverter. Simulation and experimental results verify the simplicity and applicability of median filters for control and sensing in power electronics applications. Results show significant improvement in the filter output quality for all three applications compared to the filter input where numerical errors, data acquisition glitches, and noise are significantly reduced or eliminated in the output.

AB  - Silt accumulation and sedimentation in canal beds leads to deterioration of watercourses over time. Every year a forced closure of the canals in the Indus basin is inevitable for canal cleaning, entailing a very large scale and costly operation. Silt removal precision is prone to inefficiencies due to subjective decision making in the cleaning process. In this paper, we lay out a theoretical framework to map the semi-structured (emptied) canal bed terrains with an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) system for quantitative inspection of deposited silt. The study employs Gaussian process regression on sampled points to determine a continuous distribution of silt surface, thereby, predicting the volume of silt on canal bed. Our theoretical analysis builds upon certain mathematical bounds on the variance of estimated volume, while explicitly considering localization error and sensor noise. Essentially, we setup a framework for studying how tolerable are the process and measurement uncertainties, while achieving a desired accuracy in silt profile and corresponding volume. We demonstrate the regression results in simulations as well as lab-scaled-model (LMS151 laser scanner) with different sets of parameters. Volume estimation is verified practically and mathematical performance limits are proposed in established aerial canal inspection system.

Geroch (2004). A bottleneck in the animation production process is in the clean-up of capture sessions to remove and/or correct anomalous (unusable) frames and noise. In this paper, an investigation is carried out on the use of a system comprising of two layers of self-organising maps in identifying anomalous frames in a magnetic motion capture session

AB  - Historically, the sliding contact within a potentiometer position sensor has been made from metal and was compatible with the metal wire wound elements originally in use. As the technology developed, the wire wound element was replaced with a carbon based resistive ink track. This change provided major technical and economic advantages but introduced incompatibility between the contact and track. Initially, when life requirements were in the range of one million or less cycles and the currents through the contact were higher, this incompatibility was tolerated. As life requirements increased to the present levels, in hundreds of millions of cycles; and currents reduced to the dry circuit range, it became more difficult to penetrate various barriers and transmit a clean noise free signal. The interface between the two dissimilar materials has produced a delicate balance upon which the wear and increases in contact resistance have an adverse effect on the performance of the unit. A natural progression was to find a contact material more compatible with the carbon based resistive ink tracks. Previous work has indicated the feasibility of the use of carbon fiber as a replacement for the metal in the contact, but has not provided the structure that will satisfy the mechanical, electrical, and environmental requirements of the product. Further development has produced a carbon fiber composite material to satisfy these requirements. This paper presents the test program used for the evaluation of this new material, showing the results, conclusions, and design considerations in the utilization of this product.

AB  - In recent decades, many indoor positioning techniques have been researched and some approaches have even been developed into consumer products. Most of them have been deployed into companies which benefit from indoor asset tracking. However, for public buildings like libraries or transportation systems, no direct benefit exists by installing expensive systems. Inertial navigation systems offer a form of positioning which is almost completely independent from external infrastructures, inexpensive and privacy friendly. As prices for sensors continuously drop, mobile terminals, such as cell phones or tablet PCs, are being equipped with various additional components, like GPS, cameras and light sensors, and moreover gyroscopes, compasses and accelerometers integration is also becoming commonplace. These last three components enable inertial navigation systems to calculate the position of the device. In this paper, we selected two devices, the iPhone 3GS and the iPhone 4, to analyze their sensors for usability of an inertial navigation system. For each device a common strapdown algorithm was implemented and varying standard filters applied to clean the output data stream of the sensors. Finally, we present the results, which are diverse according to the devices.

AB  - Photographing distant objects is challenging for a number of reasons. Even on a clear day, atmospheric haze often represents the majority of light received by a camera. Unfortunately, dehazing alone cannot create a clean image. The combination of shot noise and quantization noise is exacerbated when the contrast is expanded after haze removal. Dust on the sensor that may be unnoticeable in the original images creates serious artifacts. Multiple images can be averaged to overcome the noise, but the combination of long lenses and small camera motion as well as time varying atmospheric refraction results in large global and local shifts of the images on the sensor. An iconic example of a distant object is Mount Rainier, when viewed from Seattle, which is 90 kilometers away. This paper demonstrates a methodology to pull out a clean image of Mount Rainier from a series of images. Rigid and non-rigid alignment steps brings individual pixels into alignment. A novel local weighted averaging method based on ideas from “lucky imaging” minimizes blur, resampling and alignment errors, as well as effects of sensor dust, to maintain the sharpness of the original pixel grid. Finally, dehazing and contrast expansion results in a sharp clean image.

AB  - The advancements in wireless communication technology and micro electro mechanical system (MEMS) based sensor technology led to the rise of body area communication in healthcare field. The bio signals acquired through this on-body communication mainly suffers from motion artifacts caused by shadowing due to the body shape and body movement. These noises may lead to wrong prediction on data. Therefore, it is important to consider denoising the bio signals in order to perform accurate diagnosis and analysis. This paper proposes regularized denoising autoencoder (DAE) to reconstruct the clean signal from its noisy form. Here two regularization terms L1 and L2 which updates the cost function to avoid over fitting problem. This paper proves that L1 is better than L2 in terms of recovering the signal quality and it is measured by Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR). The dataset used here are taken from a neurokit a python tool box for statistics and neurophysiological signal processing.

AB  - In-shore and off-shore wind farms are nowadays representing strategic assets for the generation of clean energy. However their presence interferes with existing surveillance systems, such as primary radar systems. In order to achieve painless coexistence of radar and wind farms systems, solutions can be explored from both the renewable energy and radar communities. In particular, this paper deals with the latter aspect, proposing signal processing solutions able to allow a radar system to mitigate the deleterious effects of a wind farm within its surveillance area. This paper proposes a joint radar waveform and filter design aimed to optimize the Signal plus Interference to Noise Power Ratio (SINR) in a multi-static radar scenario. The analysis is performed on simulated data and shows that the proposed method is able to reduce the effect of wind farms.

Unlike the existing linear operation based methods, such as the signal subspace method without eigendecomposition (SUMWE) of Xin et al, that calculate the noise subspace, the RSM method finds a cleaner signal subspace by means of a successive recursion procedure. Thus, the RSM method has the advantages of computational simplicity and accurate estimation, in particular for a large array. Numerical results are presented to compare the performance the RSM method with that of the SUMWE methods.

AB  - Point clouds acquired from scanning devices are often perturbed by noise, which affects downstream tasks such as surface reconstruction and analysis. The distribution of a noisy point cloud can be viewed as the distribution of a set of noise-free samples p(x) convolved with some noise model n, leading to (p * n)(x) whose mode is the underlying clean surface. To denoise a noisy point cloud, we propose to increase the log-likelihood of each point from p * n via gradient ascent—iteratively updating each point’s position. Since p * n is unknown at test-time, and we only need the score (i.e., the gradient of the log-probability function) to perform gradient ascent, we propose a neural network architecture to estimate the score of p * n given only noisy point clouds as input. We derive objective functions for training the network and develop a denoising algorithm leveraging on the estimated scores. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods under a variety of noise models, and shows the potential to be applied in other tasks such as point cloud upsampling.

The detector can identify calcite in visible/NIR (350-2500 nm) spectra of both laboratory specimens covered by ferric dust and rocks in Mars analogue field environments. The ANN was trained using the backpropagation algorithm with sigmoid activation neurons. For the training dataset, we chose nine carbonate and eight noncarbonate representative mineral spectra from the USGS spectral library. Using these spectra as seeds, we generated 10,000 variants with up to 2% Gaussian noise in each reflectance measurement. We cross-validated several ANN architectures, training on 9,900 spectra and testing on the remaining 100. The best performing ANN correctly detected, with perfect accuracy, the presence (or absence) of carbonate in spectral data taken on field samples from the Mojave desert and clean, pure marbles from CT. Sensitivity experiments with JSC Mars-1 simulant dust suggest the carbonate detector would perform well in aeolian Martian environments.

AB  - Electricity and appliance usage information can often reveal the nature of human activities in a home. For instance, sensing the use of vacuum cleaner, a microwave oven, and kitchen appliances can give insights into a person's current activities. Instead of putting a sensor on each appliance, our technique is based on the idea that appliance usage can be sensed by their manifestations in an environment's existing electrical infrastructure. Prior approaches using this technique could only detect an appliance's on-off states; that is, they only sense “what” is being used, but not “how” it is used. In this paper, we introduce DOSE, a significant advancement for inferring operating states of electronic devices from a single sensing point in a home. When an electronic device is in operation, it generates time-varying Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) based upon its operating states (e.g., vacuuming on a rug vs. hardwood floor). This EMI noise is coupled to the power line and can be picked up from a single sensing hardware attached to the wall outlet in a house. Unlike prior data-driven approaches, we employ domain knowledge of the device's circuitry for semi-supervised model training to avoid tedious labeling process. We evaluated DOSE in a residential house for 2 months and found that operating states for 16 appliances could be estimated with an average accuracy of 93.8%. These fine-grained electrical characteristics affords rich feature sets of electrical events and have the potential to support various applications such as in-home activity inference, energy disaggregation and device failure detection.

AB  - We studied how to control the frequencies of those simple crystals used in typical telecommunication transmitter. According to the common standards, the uncertainty of carrier frequency should be less than 0.3 ppm. That of simple XO is only 100 ppm. Two approaches have been studied here. The first one is the German transmitter DCF 77. The second one is the utilization of the NTP-time servers. We studied phase distribution and calculated Allan variances, both for raw data and cleaned data. Three-standard-deviation-criterion was applied to detect outliers. The results point out, that usually DFC 77 enables sufficient phase locking in a couple of seconds. The main problem is the atmospheric noise during thunderstorms in the late summer seasons. The NTP-time servers suffer from 100 mus level time jumps. Typically the 10 min integration time is needed to achieve the 0.3 ppm accuracy. Therefore, some kind of temperature compensation of those XOs is needed to fulfill the requirements.

AB  - Background noise reduction has been studied for many years. However, unwanted human speech noise suppression is not well discussed due to sparsity of the speech signal. Traditional blind source separation (BSS) methods such as independent component analysis (ICA) assume the prior knowledge of the number of sources and require that the number of sources must equal the number of sensors. Above limitations prevent the practical use of speech enhancement using traditional BSS for mobile phone communication. In this paper, a combination method of BSS and speaker recognition system (SRS) is developed for target speech extraction in underdetermined cases. By estimating each independent speech from speech mixture using binary mask over time-frequency (T- F) domain, clean speeches can be separated. By comparing Mel frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) of each separated clean speech with the trained MFCC, distortions can be calculated out. The separated clean speech with the smallest distortion is regarded as the target speech. Through a series of validations, optimum parameters for BSS and SRS are obtained. Additionally, the proposed method shows robustness in human-generated background noise suppression.

AB  - Continuous tracking of heart activity from an Electrocardiogram (ECG) signal to assist physicians in treating Cardio Vascular Disease (CVD) requires a miniaturized and power-efficient design for long-time continuous monitoring. The work presents an ultra-low-power bio-potential acquisition and 11b successive approximation register (SAR) analog to digital converter (ADC) to acquire clean ECG signal and digitized data for further on-sensor processing, respectively. The designed low-noise amplifier (LNA) targets a wearable environment utilizing an AC coupled chopper technique to reject rail-to-rail electrode DC offset (EDO), 50/60 Hz interference, and mitigate flicker noise. The proposed analog front end (AFE) is implemented utilizing a CMOS 180nm technology and consumes 1.3uA of current while operating @ 1V. The system achieves NEF and input-referred noise of 2.67 and 50nV/&#x221A;Hz, respectively, with an effective number of bits (ENOB) of 10.1.

AB  - A new wavelet-based multi-feature voiced/unvoiced speech classification algorithm is presented. The algorithm is based on statistical analysis of wavelet-based frequency distribution of the average energy, zero-crossing rate, and average energy of short-time segments of the speech signal. The algorithm first classifies the input speech into voiced, unvoiced and uncertain parts by comparing features with predetermined thresholds. Then, the uncertain parts are treated in three conditions and dynamic thresholds are computed by extracted features of the input signal. Finally, the dynamic thresholds are used to classify the uncertain parts. The performance of the algorithm has been evaluated using a large speech database. The algorithm is shown to perform well in the cases of both clean and noise-degraded speech.

AB  - This work is dedicated to developing a novel three dimensional structure for electrochemical measurements in neuronal studies. The final prototype will allow not only for the study and culture on chip of neuronal cells, but also of brain tissue. The use of out-of-plane electrodes instead of planar ones increases the sensitivity of the system and increases the signal-to-noise ratio in the recorded signals, due to the higher availability of surface area. The main bottleneck of the out-of-plane electrode fabrication lies in the metallization process for transforming them into active electrodes, since the coverage of the side walls of almost vertical pillars is not trivial by standard processes in a clean room facility. This paper will discuss the different steps taken towards this goal and present the results that we have obtained so far.

AB  - We consider the problem of assigning a class label to the noisy output of a linear system, where clean feature examples are available for training. We design a robust classifier that operates on a linear estimate, with uncertainty modeled by a Gaussian distribution with parameters derived from the bias and covariance of a linear estimator. Class-conditional distributions are modeled locally as Gaussians. Since estimation of Gaussian parameters from few training samples can be illposed, we extend recent work in Bayesian quadratic discriminant analysis to derive a robust local generative classifier. Experiments show a statistically significant improvement over prior art.

AB  - Denoising is the representative task in hyperspectral image (HSI) processing. This letter proposes to produce a classification-driven HSI denoiser, which is capable of simultaneously reducing noise and preserving semantic-aware detail. The conditional neural adversarial network and multiple loss functions are introduced to produce visually pleasing images by enforcing an additional constraint that the denoised image must be indistinguishable from its corresponding ground-truth clean image. Experiments are performed on hyperspectral remote sensing images containing both the simulated hybrid noise and real noise. The results show that the proposed model outperforms many state-of-the-art denoising methods for HSIs.

AB  - In this article, we present a new development with test results on the sonar uncertainty model and the relevant processing of the interferometric bathymetry sounding data. Within a sonar sounding solution, not only an angle and time-delay pair is resolved, but quality factor, angle uncertainty and signal to noise ratio (SNR), with which the angle solution is obtained, are provided as well for the completeness of the data fields required for post processing. The goal is to generate a final sounding with registered uncertainties in three dimensions. As a result, the quality factor and SNR are applied to eliminate the low quality angle solutions due to backscatter from either multiple path or shadow area. The cleaned angle and time delay pair is then used for the estimation of the local depth, registered with the depth uncertainty derived from the angle uncertainty. The resolved depth plus its uncertainty, along with data from other sensors (IMU and SVP) and their related uncertainties, are processed by the Combined Uncertainty and Bathymetry Estimator (CUBE) [1] to generate a final mapping solution registered by a total propagated uncertainty to be checked against IHO S-44 at different order levels. From another view point, the SNR is a measurement of both the signal quality at each spatial sample and the coherence between the data streams from different bathymetric transducer receive staves. The coherence measurement is helpful to determine the valid angle apart from the nadir from which a robust sounding solution can be obtained in a full ping. It is evident that the SNR streams computed from different receiver pairs start to converge from an angle α apart from the nadir. The angle solutions within α would be considered as only fine quality due to the de-correlation introduced by different spacing among the receive staves. Conventionally, sonar manufacturers specify angles ~35 deg to start processing the data. However, with the new capability, α is determined from real-time data and is adaptively adjusted in situ based on the bottom, depth, motion, and other acoustic environments. First, a Sonar Uncertainty Model is presented. It is a Simulink (Matlab) package composed of Sonar Simulation Toolsets (Applied Physics Lab, University of Washington, Seattle), Klein Bathymetry Engine, and statistical processing. Second, in a cooperative effort with the Center for Coastal and Ocean Mapping/Joint Hydrographic Center (CCOM/JHC), sea trial data has been processed to evaluate the uncertainty model. Third, a full data set collected from Portsmouth, N.H. by a Klein HydroChart 5000 has been processed by CARIS through CUBE application. Analysis results are discussed and demonstrated.

AB  - The identification of parameters of spatially variant blurs given a clean image and its blurry noisy version is a challenging inverse problem of interest in many application fields, such as biological microscopy and astronomical imaging. In this paper, we consider a parametric form for the blur and introduce a state-space model that describes the statistical dependence among the neighboring kernels. Our Bayesian approach aims at estimating the posterior distributions of the kernel parameters given the available data. Since those posteriors are not tractable due to the nonlinearities of the model, we propose a sequential Monte Carlo approach to approximate the distributions by processing the data in an online manner. This allows to consider numerous overlapped patches and large scale images at reasonable computational and memory costs. Moreover, it provides a measure of uncertainty due to the Bayesian framework. Practical experimental results illustrate the good performance of our novel approach, emphasizing the benefit to exploit the spatial structure for an improved estimation quality.

AB  - In this paper, we propose a real-time hand gesture recognition system, using a thinning method which utilizes a stereo camera and implements a Korean chess game system. We implement a depth map in the hand detection portion which uses the sum of absolute differences method, based on the acquired right-left image of detecting the foreground object. We use a convex hull to detect the regions of interest (ROI) and calculate the depth of the object in the ROI in order to obtain more accurate hand images. Then, we remove the background image in the ROI and get the foreground image as a hand image. Finally, we use a blob-labeling method to obtain the clean hand image, without the noise caused by computing distance from stereo matching. The hand gesture recognition system uses the Zhang and Suen thinning algorithm to obtain feature point, angle and distance. This system recognizes five types of hand gestures. The proposed method achieves an average recognition rate of 83%. At last, we applied the gesture recognition result to the Korean chess game system which can move the chess pieces by hand.

AB  - The problem of image noise is prevalent in various visual recognition tasks. This problem arises due to multiple factors like insufficient illumination, low-quality camera sensors, background-clutters, etc. Low-quality images incur degraded performance for visual recognition tasks like classification, object detection, because of the noise present in the image. Thus, mostly the latest image recognition benchmarks and methods, such as Pascal Visual Object Classes Challenges and Microsoft Common Objects in Context Challenges, rely primarily on clean and high-definition images. Furthermore, image noise is a typical problem in real-time applications like surveillance, autonomous vehicles, etc. To tackle this bothersome problem of underperformance of visual recognition tasks, particularly object detection, due to inclusion of noise in real-time scenarios, a technique has been proposed to reduce the image noise's impact on the object detection task and improve its performance altogether. A two-phase pipeline is introduced, in which the first phase consists ofremoving noise from the low-quality image, and the second stage includes accomplishing the object detection process by employing the standard Single-shot multibox object detector. The proposed approach is evaluated on the Pascal Visual Object Classes benchmark. The detection results and image denoising results exhibit the efficiency of the proposed technique for reliable object detection with varying image noise levels.

AB  - NASA continuously monitors spacecraft surfaces to assure a very low presence of bacterial endospores upon landing on the surface of Mars. In order to meet the rigid schedules of spacecraft assembly, a more rapid, sensitive spore detection assay is being considered as an alternate method to the current three-day NASA standard culture-based assay. The millipore microstar rapid system (RMDS) has been used successfully for rapid bioburden enumeration in a wide range of applications. It combines membrane filtration, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) bioluminescence chemistry, and image analysis based on photon detection with a charge coupled device (CCD) camera. The RMDS is rapid and simple, shows high sensitivity (1 colony forming unit [CFU]/sample), and correlates excellently with traditional culture-based methods. In addition, by utilizing the milliflex filtration system, the RMDS is ideal for sampling both large sample volumes and those samples containing inhibitory substances. In this study, we have evaluated the use of the RMDS as a rapid spore detection tool for NASA planetary protection applications. This is accomplished by preceding the RMDS incubation protocol with a heat shock step, 15 minutes at 80degC, as a direct selection of spores. Different luciferase enzymes were tested in order to reduce the typical 18-24 hour incubation time to ~5 hours. Of the reagents evaluated, a formulation of a highly sensitive bioluminescence reagent was found to be more sensitive than the present millipore microstar reagents. Assay times of ~5 hours were repeatedly demonstrated along with low image background noise. In order to evaluate the applicability of this method, seven species of Bacillus (nine strains) that have been repeatedly isolated from clean room environments were assayed. All strains were detected in ~5 hours. The improved RMDS-based spore detection is under validation and is expected to achieve the goal of "same shift" measurement of spore bioburden during spacecraft assembly

AB  - This paper proposes a novel method to estimate heart rate variability (HRV) and interbeat interval (IBI) in the presence of motion artifacts. A robust heartbeat selection method is introduced as a shortest path exploration problem to detect HRV/IBI from a noisy signal. The time-continuity of heartbeats is used to model the shortest path. The end point of one heartbeat is the starting point of the next one. A graph is constructed whose vertices and edges are assumed to be the beginning of each possible heartbeats and the IBIs, respectively. Weights are assigned to the edges by using average heart rate (HR) values from state-of-the-art algorithms. The results indicate that IBI percentage error is around 3% for distorted ECG signal even with 0dB SNR. In addition, HRV parameters of clean versus noisy signals show high correlation.

AB  - The current trend in embedded systems is to make them surrounding the users, providing services thanks to a knowledge of their environment. These self-awareness and context-awareness properties are provided by numerous sensors, from different types. Using the provided information causes at least two problems: the fusion of data from different sources, and the noise induced by sensors which are closer from the processing unit than ever. Additionally, the needed applications that use these information are based on different recognition processings, sometimes not easy to formalize with conventional algorithms. Processing chains using neural-based algorithms are promising approaches for solving these kinds of issues. Unfortunately, embedding bio-inspired algorithms in an embedded system is not so easy since there is no exploration environment for this specific task. Moreover, neural networks often need pre- or postprocessing of data for optimal operation. In fact, there is a balance to find between pre-processing and neural network processing: for example, adding more filtering to clean or to transform data (like convolution filters or FFT) enables to have smaller neural networks, leading to less number of neurons, less learning time and finally more efficient applications. This paper presents early results of a collaboration towards the design of such an exploration environment coming from a joint laboratory between an SME and a Research Institute. The main object coming from the current collaboration is the coupling of a rich exploration environnement of embedded systems (including multi/manycore) with a neural network exploration tool. The combination of the two enables us to have feedbacks concerning both algorithm efficiency and performances and other non-functional metrics regarding the target system for driving the co-design cycle of industrial embedded systems.

AB  - A numerical simulator is developed to assess various design implications of a digital correlator used by a synthetic aperture interferometric radiometer (SAIR). The simulator permits control of the type of digitization, the digitization thresholds with respect to noise power, and the degree of correlation between the two antenna signals which are being cross correlated. Digitization schemes are considered which use 2, 3, 4, and 8 levels. Estimates are made of the increase in inherent radiometer noise (/spl Delta/T) due to the digitization. The increase in /spl Delta/T is found to depend strongly on the degree of correlation, with higher correlations suffering less increase. In most cases, 3 level digitization is recommended based on this sensitivity consideration. Two levels perform significantly noisier and four levels only slightly cleaner. Several case studies are also considered regarding the need to control the signal level relative to the digitizer thresholds. Automatic gain control circuitry prior to digitization is found not to be necessary, provided the thresholds are preset within a fairly broad region of minimum sensitivity to variations in signal power, and provided the system noise temperature of the radiometer is monitored with reasonable accuracy. It is also found that, under conditions of very high correlation between the two signals, digital correlators have better SNR performance than analog. Reasons for this behavior are discussed.<>

AB  - Deep learning (DL) based hyperspectral images (HSIs) denoising approaches directly learn the nonlinear mapping between noisy and clean HSI pairs. They usually do not consider the physical characteristics of HSIs. This drawback makes the models lack interpretability that is key to understanding their denoising mechanism and limits their denoising ability. In this paper, we introduce a novel model-guided interpretable network for HSI denoising to tackle this problem. Fully considering the spatial redundancy, spectral low-rankness, and spectral-spatial correlations of HSIs, we first establish a subspace-based multidimensional sparse (SMDS) model under the umbrella of tensor notation. After that, the model is unfolded into an end-to-end network named SMDS-Net, whose fundamental modules are seamlessly connected with the denoising procedure and optimization of the SMDS model. This makes SMDS-Net convey clear physical meanings, i.e., learning the low-rankness and sparsity of HSIs. Finally, all key variables are obtained by discriminative training. Extensive experiments and comprehensive analysis on synthetic and real-world HSIs confirm the strong denoising ability, strong learning capability, promising generalization ability, and high interpretability of SMDS-Net against the state-of-the-art HSI denoising methods. The source code and data of this article will be made publicly available at https://github.com/bearshng/smds-net for reproducible research.

AB  - Long term continuous monitoring of electrocardiogram (ECG) in a free living environment provides valuable information for the prevention on the heart attack and other high risk diseases. Most of the existing devices provide ECG recording in a hospital setting or off-line ECG diagnosis. The design of a real-time wearable ECG monitoring device with cardiac arrhythmia classification system is discussed in this paper. In this system, the wearable sensor node monitors the patient's ECG and motion signal in an unobstructive way that the patient's daily life will not be affected. ECG analog front-end and on-node processing are designed to remove most of the noise and bias, which guarantees an clean and reliable ECG waveform. The ECG waveform is digitalized by an analog-to-digital convertor and transmitted to a smart phone via bluetooth. On the smartphone, the ECG waveform is visualized and a novel layered hidden Markov model is implemented to classify multiple cardiac arrhythmias in real time. This paper evaluates the performance of the hardware design and the classification algorithm.

AB  - Urban environments are characterised by the presence of distinctive audio signals which alert the drivers to events that require prompt action. The detection and interpretation of these signals would be highly beneficial for smart vehicle systems, as it would provide them with complementary information to navigate safely in the environment. In this paper, we present a framework that spots the presence of acoustic events, such as horns and sirens, using a two-stage approach. We first model the urban soundscape and use anomaly detection to identify the presence of an anomalous sound, and later determine the nature of this sound. As the audio samples are affected by copious non-stationary and unstructured noise, which can degrade classification performance, we propose a noise-removal technique to obtain a clean representation of the data we can use for classification and waveform reconstruction. The method is based on the idea of analysing the spectrograms of the incoming signals as images and applying spectrogram segmentation to isolate and extract the alerting signals from the background noise. We evaluate our framework on four hours of urban sounds collected driving around urban Oxford on different kinds of road and in different traffic conditions. When compared to traditional feature representations, such as Mel-frequency cepstrum coefficients, our framework shows an improvement of up to 31% in the classification rate.

AB  - Objective: Noise reduction algorithms in current hearing devices lack informationabout the sound source a user attends to when multiple sources are present. To resolve this issue, they can be complemented with auditory attention decoding (AAD) algorithms, which decode the attention using electroencephalography (EEG) sensors. State-of-the-art AAD algorithms employ a stimulus reconstruction approach, in which the envelope of the attended source is reconstructed from the EEG and correlated with the envelopes of the individual sources. This approach, however, performs poorly on short signal segments, whilelonger segments yield impractically long detection delays when the user switches attention. Methods: We propose decoding the directional focus of attention using filterbank common spatial pattern filters (FB-CSP) as an alternative AAD paradigm, whichdoes not require access to the clean source envelopes. Results: The proposed FB-CSP approach outperforms both the stimulus reconstruction approach on short signal segments, as well as a convolutional neural network approach on the same task. We achieve a high accuracy (80% for 1 s windows and 70% for quasi-instantaneous decisions), which is sufficient to reach minimal expected switch durations below 4 s. We also demonstrate that the decoder can adapt to unlabeled data from anunseen subject and works with only a subset of EEG channels located around the ear to emulate a wearable EEG setup. Conclusion: The proposed FB-CSP method provides fast and accurate decoding of the directional focus of auditory attention. Significance: The high accuracy on very short data segments is a major step forward towards practical neuro-steered hearing devices.

AB  - Complex propagation channels in indoor environments introduce considerable clutter and distortions to frontal radar images. Autoencoders, when provided with corrupted and corresponding clean images during training, can learn how to mitigate clutter in these images during testing. The main advantage is that an analytical framework of the channel is not required. On the other hand, the algorithm relies on the availability of a large database of correctly labelled training data - the target scenarios in cluttered environments must be exactly replicated in free space. We propose to augment the conventional denoising autoencoder with sparsity based multiple layer representations to handle the labelling mismatch errors. We hypothesize that the deeper representations with sparsity constraints will enable extraction of more fundamental features of the images. Our radar data consists of measurements made with a wideband RF imaging sensor called the Walabot. Our algorithm improves upon the conventional autoencoder in terms of performance with respect to signal to clutter and signal to noise ratios, labelling mismatch errors and computational time during testing.

AB  - HfC was evaluated as a cold field emission source. Single crystal HfC was produced and fabricated into cold field emitters, then angular intensity and reduced brightness were determined from experimental I(V) data. Energy distribution data were in agreement with a theoretical model. The reduced brightness, energy distribution, and emission stability are compared to commercially available sources which show that HfC produced a higher brightness and a lower energy spread than a W cold field source or a ZrO/W Schottky emitter. HfC maintains its emission level for one hour in moderate UHV condition; a dramatic improvement over the stability of W. This combined with a durability that allows for frequent flash cleaning without degradation of the emitter end form make HfC a highly promising source. We compared stability and noise to emission from a tungsten tip at the same angular intensity. By increasing the emitter temperature slightly, stability is improved while maintaining a low energy spread.

AB  - This paper presents a new and simple method to noninvasively localize failure sites in an insulated-gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) module by using a magnetic probe. The method detects the magnetic field generated by leakage currents occurring at the broken gates of an IGBT module. In this method, not only an RF stimulus signal but also a dc bias voltage is applied to the IGBT module under test, because the resistance of the failure site's change depends upon the dc bias condition. A high-sensitivity magnetic probe is used to detect the magnetic field to locate the corresponding fault positions. The magnetic probe is fully integrated onto a chip by a 180-nm CMOS process and includes a magnetic pickup coil, a low-noise amplifier, a downconversion mixer, and a low-pass filter. Magnetic scanning experiments are implemented for two kinds of IGBT module samples to demonstrate the detection of the broken gate positions. In addition, a visual confirmation of the broken gate positions is performed. Several postprocessing steps in a clean room are applied to these samples in order to visually confirm the scanning results of the proposed method. Experimental results successfully demonstrate that our method can be used for noninvasive localization of small intrinsic faults, on two kinds of SiC and Si substrates, of IGBT modules.

AB  - In recent years, the development of multi-sensor has emphasized the need to directly process multi-channel (multivariate) data. In this paper, a novel multivariate synchrosqueezing wavelet transform denoising method combined with subspace projection (SWT-SP) is proposed. One of the key points of this method is to obtain an optimal orthogonal matrix which can project a multivariate observation signal to a signal subspace occupied by a clean signal and an orthogonal noise subspace occupied by noise. Furthermore, the high dimensional time-frequency representation based on the synchrosqueezing transform realizes the multichannel signal information fusion, and the subspace projection makes full use of the spatial diversity characteristics of the observed signal. Finally, signal energy produces the aggregation effect in the former dimension space, which improves the signal-to-noise ratio(SNR) of signals in the signal subspace. The performance of this algorithm for standard multichannel denoising is verified on both real-world data and synthetic signals. The reconstructed signal obtained the improvement of the highest SNR by about 6 dB under different conditions.

AB  - Heart Rate is one of the fundamental parameters to judge the fitness of a human body. Over history, many techniques have been used like a stethoscope and some very crude ones like manually tapping the wrist. The aim of this paper is to propose an Optical Heart rate monitor and its implementation in smart health monitoring systems. A technique named Photoplethysmogram is explored. The advantage of this technique lies in its simplicity, low cost, small form factor and ease of implementation in a smart system. Although the design is simple it poses a challenge of perfect amplification and filtering out noise in order to get a smooth and accurate waveform. The paper discusses Analog Front-end design and noise reduction. Once clean data is obtained, its integration with multiple platforms like PC, smartphone is investigated thus pushing towards a smart health-care system.

AB  - The event camera is a novel sensor that records brightness change in the form of asynchronous events with high temporal resolution, and simultaneously outputs intensity images with a lower frame rate. Events recorded by sensors have a lot of noise and the intensity images captured often suffer from motion blur and noise effects. Therefore, to reconstruct high quality images is of great significance for the application of event camera in computer vision. However, the existing reconstruction methods only addressed the motion blur issue without considering the influence of noise. In this paper, we propose a variational model by using spatial smooth constraint regularization to recover clean image frames from blurry and noisy camera images and events at any frame rate. We present experimental results on synthetic dataset as well as real dataset with high speed and high dynamic range to demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is superior to the other reconstruction algorithms.

AB  - Fault diagnostics involving the Internet of Things (IoT) sensors and edge devices is a challenging task due to their limited energy and computational capabilities. Another challenge concerning IoT sensors or devices is the incursion of noise when used in an industrial environment. The noisy samples affect the decision support system that could lead to financial and operational losses. This paper proposes a Noisy Encoder using Artificial Intelligence of Things (NEAT) architecture for fault diagnosis in IoT edge devices. NEAT combines autoencoders and Inception module to co-train the clean and noisy samples for solving the said problem. Experimental results on benchmark datasets reveal that the NEAT architecture is noise resilient in comparison to the existing works. Furthermore, we also show that the NEAT architecture has lightweight characteristics as it yields a lower number of parameters, weight storage, training, and testing times that support its real-life applicability in an Industrial IoT environment.

AB  - The capacity to identify the contamination in surface electromyography (sEMG) signals is necessary for applying the sEMG controlled prosthesis over time. In this paper, the method for the automatic identification of commonly occurring contaminant types in sEMG signals is evaluated. The presented approach uses two-class support vector machine (SVM) trained with clean sEMG and artificially contaminated sEMG. The contaminants considered include electrocardiogram interference, motion artefact, power line interference, amplifier saturation, and electrode displacement. The results demonstrated that the sEMG signal with the contaminants could readily be distinguished, even with increase channels degraded. The SFTD detection depends on the noise type, whether the amputee or non-amputee subjects and which channel is being analysed. This method presented a suitable solution for the detection of contaminants in the sEMG signal, being able to provide the acquired signal validation before the movement intended recognition to operate in an intelligent recognition with greater reliability.

AB  - Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of progressive vision loss in the elderly. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a promising diagnostic tool for early detection and management of AMD. However, the speckle noise and low resolution (LR) of the OCT images affect its diagnostic viabilities. Therefore, denoising and super-resolution (SR) techniques present a potential solution to improve the quality of the OCT images. Recent methods rely on example-based approaches that require paired LR and high resolution (HR) images for training. However, the large scale acquisition of paired LR-HR images presents pertinent challenges in clinical settings. Therefore, this work proposes an unsupervised framework using the generative adversarial network (GAN) to perform fast and reliable SR without the requirement of aligned LR-HR pairs. We use adversarial learning with cycle consistency and identity mapping priors to preserve the spatial correlation, color and texture details in the generated clean HR images. Experimental results on clinical-grade OCT images show that the proposed method outperforms the existing methods both in terms of SR performance and computational time. Improved classification accuracy of 96.54% is obtained when the generated images are used for automated AMD diagnosis. The enhanced generalizability and faithful reconstruction attributes make the proposed method suitable for assisting ophthalmologists in better diagnosis and treatment planning.

AB  - The non-intrusive human activity recognition has been envisioned as a key enabler for many emerging applications requiring interactions between humans and computing systems. To accurately recognize different human behaviors, ubiquitous wireless signals are widely adopted, e.g., Wi-Fi signals, whose Channel State Information can precisely reflect human movements. Unfortunately, nearly all Wi-Fi-based recognition systems assume a clean wireless environment, i.e., no interference will compromise the developed algorithms, which, apparently, is not feasible in practice. Even worse, for systems using Wi-Fi 2.4GHz signals, the widely existing interference from coexisting protocols, such as ZigBee, Bluetooth, and LTE-Unlicensed, can easily compromise the recognition process, posing a hard limit on further enhancing the accuracy. Therefore, this work uncovers a new wireless adversarial attack against Wi-Fi-based human activity recognition systems, by intentionally injecting interference using coexisting protocol signals. The contaminated Wi-Fi signal will distort CSI estimation and finally output a false recognition result. Different from traditional jamming attacks, this new adversarial attack is intelligent and stealthy in terms of avoiding being detected from traffic analysis. Along with both theoretical analysis and extensive real-world experiments, we have shown this newly-identified attack can easily compromise many existing Wi-Fi-based human recognition systems while still bypassing malicious signal detection schemes.

AB  - Wearable technologies have made ubiquitous, non-invasive continuous monitoring of vital signs outside of the clinical setting possible. Convenient and user friendly embedded sensors in wearable technologies such as wristbands or watch, unlike cumbersome electrocardiogram Holter monitors, have made long term monitoring possible in normal home/home-care setting. However, such vital sign monitors are highly susceptible to motion artifacts and hence the quality of signal suffers. In order to develop a reliable automated technique to estimate vital signs, it is necessary to understand and estimate the quality of the acquired signal. In this paper, we compare the characteristics of signal corrupted by motion artifact against the artifact-free photoplethysmographic (PPG) signal acquired from an Empatica E4 wristband over 24 hours from 15 participants as the first step toward understanding and quantifying the quality of PPG signals. Using four 10 second segments of artifact-free and clean PPG signal from each participant, features that describe the signal are extracted. Bhattacharyya distance measure is used to rank the features that represent quality of the PPG signal. Using set of highly ranked features, a Naïve Bayes classifier is designed to quantify the quality of the PPG signal.

AB  - In this study, we propose a novel procedure "RepMA" based on image processing of recurrence plots to detect motion artifacts (MA) in PPG signals. The idea is by using recurrence plots we convert the signal into a binary image that can be processed later for distortion and corruption. The algorithm runs on each 4 sec segments of the signal and the recurrence plot (image) of each segment is then preprocessed and analyzed to determine if the segment is clean or corrupted by noise. The MAs change the signal recurrence behavior and their irregular recurrence patterns that can be utilized to distinguish between clean and corrupted PPG segment. We used the lab controlled PPG recordings from forehead and finger pulse oximeter sensors with random movements for evaluating of RepMA performance. The results of RepMA algorithm were compared to two different algorithms known for their alleged competency in MA detection: the Hjorth and Shannon entropy. The proposed detection method outperforms the two other methods in terms of accuracy, run-time, specificity and sensitivity. Moreover, our algorithm is able to be implemented in real-time.

AB  - The accelerated move toward the adoption of the Industrial Internet-of-Things (IIoT) paradigm has resulted in numerous shortcomings as far as security is concerned. One of the IIoT affecting critical security threats is what is termed as the false data injection (FDI) attack. The FDI attacks aim to mislead the industrial platforms by falsifying their sensor measurements. FDI attacks have successfully overcome the classical threat detection approaches. In this article, we present a novel method of FDI attack detection using autoencoders (AEs). We exploit the sensor data correlation in time and space, which in turn can help identify the falsified data. Moreover, the falsified data are cleaned using the denoising AEs (DAEs). Performance evaluation proves the success of our technique in detecting FDI attacks. It also significantly outperforms a support vector machine (SVM)-based approach used for the same purpose. The DAE data cleaning algorithm is also shown to be very effective in recovering clean data from corrupted (attacked) data.

AB  - Unresolved scatterers (separated by less than a 3-dB matched filter main lobe width) are known to degrade the matching pursuit performances in radar: It tends to generate spurious detection or miss weaker targets, hidden in strong sidelobes. In this paper, we propose a new matching pursuit algorithm performing a subspace radar resolution cell rejection. The philosophy is the following: As it is usually not possible to distinguish several unresolved scatterers, we do not try to distinguish them, but when a scatterer is detected, then every contribution in the corresponding resolution cell should be cleaned. For that, the continuous cell interval is approximated by a subspace and the corresponding orthogonal projector is build. The projector basis is chosen so that it minimizes the projection residue inside the interval and a method is proposed to select its dimension according to the rejected target SNR. We show that it enables to control the sidelobe level after rejection (orthogonal projection) so that the sidelobe detection probability can be maintained low. It allows matching pursuit to work well even if the target parameter distribution differs from a delta Dirac distribution inside the matched filter resolution cell.

AB  - This paper proposes a new fetal monitoring system, including the acquisition and the processing of fetal heart sounds (FHS). Based on the foundation of the stethoscope principle, a single-channel, non-invasive sensor is designed to acquire the fetal heart sounds, in which polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane material is used as the core transducer. In the fetal heart sounds processing part, we propose a new method for denoising based on adaptive support vector regression (SVR) which has a good performance on curve fitting and effectively weakens the interference of additive noise. Thus, the clean fetal heart signals extracted from the interfered source can be further utilized to draw the fetal phonocardiogram (FPCG) and calculate the fetal heart rate (FHR).

AB  - Depth sensors have become increasingly popular in interactive computer vision applications. Currently, most of these applications are limited to indoor use. Popular IR-based depth sensors cannot provide depth data when exposed to sunlight. In these cases, one can still obtain depth information using a stereo camera set up or a special outdoor Time-of-Flight camera, at the cost of a reduced quality of the depth image. The resulting depth images are often incomplete and suffer from low resolution, noise and missing information. The aim of this paper is to recover the missing depth information based on an extension of SEEDS superpixels [11]. The superpixel segmentation algorithm is extended to take depth information into account where available. The approach takes advantage of the boundary-updating property of SEEDS. The result is a clean segmentation that recovers the missing depth information in a low-quality depth image. We test the approach outdoors on an interactive urban robot. The system is used to segment a person in front of the robot, and to detect body parts for interaction with the robot using pointing gestures.

Exploiting such input to gain awareness of an incident is a critical direction for research in effective emergency management. In this paper we present an overview of the SMART-C system, which is part of the social media initiative at the Department of Homeland Security. The system aims to enable robust bidirectional communication between emergency management and the public at large throughout the disaster life-cycle via a multitude of devices and modalities including cell phones, MMS messages, text messages, blogs, Twitter, etc. A discussion of the major components of SMART-C and related research challenges is included. These components include mechanisms to model event level semantic information, a platform for implementing multi-sensor fusion, mechanisms for estimating the veracity of information, data cleaning to reduce uncertainty and enhance accuracy of event detection and notification, and spatiotemporal analyses for pattern and trend analyses for higher level observations.

AB  - Presently ECG signal telemonitoring is one of the essential branch in telemedicine system. So it is highly desirable to construct a robust telemonitoring system through wireless body area network (WBAN) with consumption of less energy and less power. A number of traditional ECG reconstruction techniques have been proposed to recover the clean ECG data. However because of some specific behavior and characteristics of raw ECG data like non sparsity and heavy contamination of noise the traditional methods do not succeed in this application. This paper proposes an effective reconstruction method followed by Independent Component Analysis (ICA) in an intention to obtain the clean ECG data. The proposed framework includes context based learning adopted reconstruction method. Experimental results along with simulation results show that this framework is able to reconstruct the raw ECG recordings with high accuracy and high quality. Context based learning learns the existing context in the signal and reacts to changing context, which uses k-means clustering via singular value decomposition i.e. KSVD algorithm to recover raw ECG signal. In this paper, the proposed method shows better reconstruction performance than the traditional compressed sensing method retaining the sparsity of the ECG signal intact.

The signal processing method and processing flow that enable through-wall target detection are introduced. The high-speed noise and interference mitigation methods implemented in the system for through-wall target detection are also described. A series of experimental results are presented for both large and small human body movements in through-wall scenarios. It is shown that the high-resolution Doppler event history implemented in the system enables the system to recognize and distinguish a range of body movements. The results demonstrate that this real-time SDR-based wireless detection system is a low-cost solution for human movement and recognition, with a range of applications.

AB  - In this paper, we introduce a new method for removing noise from digital images, based on statistical model of wavelet coefficients. We use two-dimensional generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) model for statistical modeling of wavelet coefficients. Using two-dimensional GARCH model yields a novel wavelet coefficients model, which is capable of taking into account important characteristics of wavelet coefficients, such as non-stationarity, heavy tailed marginal distribution, and the dependencies between the coefficients. We use minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimator for estimating the clean wavelet image coefficients. Here, to prove the performance of this method in image denoising, we have compared our proposed method with various image denoising methods.

However, the environment, optics, electronics of the physical imaging systems can introduce extreme distortions and noise in the acquired images. In this work, we explore the use of reservoir computing, a dynamical neural network model inspired from biological systems, in creating dynamic image filtering systems that extracts signal from noise using inverse modeling. We discuss the possibility of implementing these networks in hardware close to the sensors.

AB  - Basic service robot technologies become more and more mature so that applications far beyond fetch and carry tasks will be possible in near future. Using a multifunctional service robot as a cleaning assistant is one interesting and challenging application. To be of any use, cleaning robots have to be able to verify the results of their work or have to find dirt in the beginning for point-wise cleaning. This paper presents an approach towards the detection of various dirt on textured surfaces using a low-cost RGB-D sensor. The algorithm aims at removing the regular part of the image with spectral residual filtering leaving only the dirt and some noise. With further post-processing it is possible to localize many kinds of dirt in the image. The proposed method is fast, reliable, quite robust to illumination changes and does not require any prior training of the surfaces to inspect.

AB  - Motion artifacts (MA) are potent sources of noise in wearable photoplethysmography (PPG) signals and can impact the estimation of heart rate (HR) of an individual. In this paper, a method using adaptive neural network filters (ANNF) is proposed for accurate estimation of HR using dual channel PPG signals and simultaneous, three - dimensional acceleration signals. The MA cancellation method using ANNF, utilizes acceleration data as input signal. The PPG signals serve as a target, while the error is the clean PPG signal. The proposed method also includes a post-processing smoothing and median filter which improves the HR estimation. The reason for this approach is that the acceleration signal in wearables are only within 3% of the ground truth value. Experimental results on datasets recorded from 12 subjects, publicly available, showed that the proposed algorithm achieves an absolute error of 1.15 beats per minute (BPM). The results also confirm that the proposed method is highly resilient to motion artifacts and maintains high accuracy for PPG estimation and compares favorably against other methods.

AB  - Smart homes aim at enhancing the quality of life of people at home by the use of home automation systems and Ambient Intelligence. Most of these smart homes provide enhanced interaction by relying on context-aware systems learned on data. Whereas voice-based interaction is the current emerging trend, most available corpora are either concerned only with home automation sensors or only with audio technology, which limits the development of context-aware voice-based systems. This paper presents the VocADom@A4H corpus, which is a dataset composed of users' interactions recorded in a fully equipped Smart Home. About 12 hours of multichannel distant speech signal synchronized with logs of an openHAB home automation system were collected from 11 participants who performed activities of daily living with the presence of real-life noises, such as other persons speaking, use of vacuum cleaner, TV, etc. This corpus can serve as a valuable material for studies in pervasive intelligence, such as human tracking, human activity recognition, context aware interaction, and robust distant speech processing in the home. Experiments performed on multichannel speech and home automation sensors data for robust voice activity detection and multiresident localization show the potential of the corpus to support the development of context-aware smart home systems.

AB  - Heart rate variability (HRV) measures the instantaneous change in heart rate and is an important marker for checking physical condition as well as mental stress of a person. In this paper, we propose a methodology to calculate HRV of a person using smart phone audio. Heart sound is captured in the inbuilt microphone of a smart phone, by placing the device on the chest of the person. We propose a process flow to make the phone captured noisy audio signal clean and audible. Furthermore, we propose a novel peak detection algorithm for accurately locating the peaks corresponding to heart sound in the noisy audio signal. The algorithm is also capable of rejecting the noisy peaks present in the captured audio that resembles heart sound pattern. Results show that the proposed methodology yields significant improvement in estimating HRV parameters compared to a clinical pulse-oximeter device, that works on the principle of photoplethysmogram (PPG) technique.

To achieve the required level of data quality in online water quality monitoring, a system for fault tolerant control was developed. A modular approach was used, in which a sensor and station management module is combined with a data validation and an event detection module. The station management module assures that all relevant data, including operational data, is available and the state of the monitoring devices is fully documented. The data validation module assures that unreliable data is detected, marked as such, and that the need for sensor maintenance is timely indicated. Finally, the event detection module marks unusual system states and triggers measures and notifications. All these modules were combined into a new software package to be used on water quality monitoring stations.

AB  - Driven by a wide range of real-world applications, several ground-breaking RF-based motion-recognition systems were proposed to detect and/or recognize macro/micro human movements. These systems often suffer from various interferences caused by multiple-users moving simultaneously, resulting in extremely low recognition accuracy. Even if the repetitive motions are fairly well detectable through the wireless signals in theory, in reality they get blended into various other system noises during the motion. Moreover, irregular motion patterns among users will lead to expensive computation cost for motion recognition. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel wireless sensing system, called Motion-Fi$\ ^+$+, which marries battery-free wireless backscattering and device-free sensing in one clean sheet. Motion-Fi$\ ^+$+ is an accurate, interference tolerable motion-recognition system, which counts repetitive motions without using scenario-dependent templates or profiles and enables multi-user performing certain motions simultaneously because of the relatively short transmission range of backscattered signals and dedicated signal separation method. We implement a backscattering wireless platform to validate our design in various scenarios for over 6 months when different persons, distances and orientations are incorporated. In our experiments, the periodicity in motions could be recognized without any learning or training process, and the accuracy of counting such motions can be achieved within 5 percent count error. With little efforts in learning the patterns, our method could achieve 95.2 percent motion-recognition accuracy for a variety of 7 typical motions. Moreover, by leveraging the periodicity of motions, the recognition accuracy could be further improved to nearly 100 percent with only three repetitions. Our experiments also show that the motions of multiple persons separating by around $ 2$ meters cause little accuracy reduction in the counting process.

AB  - Bio-signal processing performance heavily dependent on the quality of the signal. Noise removal from input signal is the primary task of this process at initial stages. This is main requirement of healthcare technology deployment for clinical usage to wearable devices with optimum power consumption and robust methods. Due to insufficient information on cleaned real-world data, performance evaluation of noise removal methods for real-world signals is currently problematic. With the advancement in sensor technology, data storage and interface technology, it provides the reliable collection of data for medical purpose. Noises generated from devices functioning, body’s internal functioning and surrounding environment of patient degrades the signal quality. With the advancement in signal processing domain significant improvement in noise removal has been achieved in recent years. Most techniques are based on the mathematical models which resembles suitably to the signal’s nature. This paper reviews the noise removal techniques used in previous works.

AB  - This paper describes a robust method for recovering an optimal DEM and its variance from multiple, randomly orientated views of a surface. The method generates a set of DEM tiles in a common coordinate system from multiple overlapping images, and then employs the concept of self-consistency to detect and remove errors from the tiles. The clean tiles are averaged together to form a low noise composite DEM. The method is tested on real and photo realistic simulated data. Results show that the method is capable of producing a virtually error free composite DEM.

AB  - We describe the key parts of our recent work to develop a planar thin-film DC SQUID with a closely-coupled spiral input coil. Our aim has been to make a device that is superior to present RF SQUID sensors in terms of sensitivity and long-term reliability. To be compatible with an RF SQUID the inductance of the input coils must be relatively large, typically 2 μH, and the input noise current in the white noise region should be below 10pA Hz-1/2. A low level of 1/f noise is also necessary for many applications and should be achieved without the use of complex noise-cancelling circuitry. Our devices meet these criteria. We include a description of work on window and edge junction fabrication using ion beam cleaning, thermal oxidation and RF plasma processing.

AB  - Visual information can improve the performance of automatic speech recognition (ASR), especially in the presence of background noise or different speech modes. A key problem is how to fuse the acoustic and visual features leveraging their complementary information and overcoming the alignment differences between modalities. Current audiovisual ASR (AV-ASR) systems rely on linear interpolation or extrapolation as a pre-processing technique to align audio and visual features, assuming that the feature sequences are aligned frame-by-frame. These pre-processing methods oversimplify the phase difference between lip motion and speech, lacking flexibility and impairing the performance of the system. This paper addresses the fusion of audiovisual features with an alignment neural network (AliNN), relying on recurrent neural network (RNN) with attention model. The proposed front-end model can automatically learn the alignment from the data. The resulting aligned features are concatenated and fed to conventional back-end ASR systems. The proposed front-end system is evaluated with matched and mismatch channel conditions, under clean and noisy recordings. The results show that our proposed approach can relatively outperform the baseline by 24.9% with Gaussian mixture model with hidden Markov model (GMM-HMM) back-end and 2.4% with deep neural network with hidden Markov model (DNN-HMM) back-end.

AB  - Target detection technique in hyperspectral imagery has been widely applied in various applications. However, its performance is severely limited by the useless interference contained in hyperspectral images (HSIs), mainly caused by the atmosphere, illumination, issues within the sensor itself, and some other factors. In this paper, we propose a hyperspectral target detector based on linear mixture model (LMM), which consists of three components. First, a hierarchical denoising autoencoder (HDAE) is specifically designed for redundant interference removal; then we apply an adaptive cluster approach to extract several representative background samples from the clean HSI; lastly, a target detector with subspace projection is developed for background suppression and target enhancement based on the clean HSI, representative background and prior-known target signatures. Experimental results on two real-world HSIs show the superiority of our proposed method, namely, the HDASP detector, comparing with other state-of-the-art target detection methods.

AB  - Benefited from the rapid and sustainable development of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors, change detection from SAR images has received increasing attentions over the past few years. Existing unsupervised deep learning-based methods have made great efforts to exploit robust feature representations, but they consume much time to optimize parameters. Besides, these methods use clustering to obtain pseudolabels for training, and the pseudolabeled samples often involve errors, which can be considered as “label noise.” To address these issues, we propose a dual path denoising network (DPDNet) for SAR image change detection. In particular, we introduce the random label propagation to clean the label noise involved in preclassification. We also propose the distinctive patch convolution for feature representation learning to reduce the time consumption. Specifically, the attention mechanism is used to select distinctive pixels in the feature maps, and patches around these pixels are selected as convolution kernels. Consequently, the DPDNet does not require a great number of training samples for parameter optimization, and its computational efficiency is greatly enhanced. Extensive experiments have been conducted on five SAR datasets to verify the proposed DPDNet. The experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms several state-of-the-art methods in change detection results.

AB  - Compared to well-established underwater acoustic communication techniques, underwater wireless optical communication (UWOC) offers significantly more transmission bandwidth and can be used in multiple short-range marine applications. Color-shift keying (CSK) is a modulation techniques advocated for deploying high data rate transmission in red, green and blue (RGB) based laser technology. It utilizes light sources that produce Lambertian light patterns. Consequently, the broadcast message arrives at the receiver via line-of-sight (LoS) pathways, with the Rician distribution being used to model the appropriate channel. This paper analyzes UWOC visible light communication (VLC) links using light emitting diodes (LDs) as transmitter with small angular divergence. The channel direct current (DC) gains is considered in the analysis to show the channel gain, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), channel capacitance, and outage probability. This study also looks at the outage probability or the locally observed SNR of the CSK link below the threshold set for a particular quality of services. The results are depicted for a random white light in an UWOC system clean ocean. They shows that the SNR of the RGB Based Laser UWOC is proportional to $P_{t}/N_{0}$. The results also shows that the channel capacity increases with $P_{t}/N_{0}$ depending on the attenuation intensity $\beta$. Finally, as the data rate increases with a fixed $P_{t}/N_{0}$, the outage probability increases. The data rate increases with $P_{t}/N_{0}$ and the transmission power with a fixed value outage probability.

AB  - In vision and machine learning, information fusion from multiple sensors can be regarded as multi-view learning paradigm to make use of the pairwise complementary information. Due to disturbed variances by illumination, equipment and environment, the collected data is frequently smeared by noises. Although there have been outlier-against works proposed, most of them suffer from redundant parameters. Even worse, few of them have modeled the cross-view complementary information. Actually, in multi-view learning, not only the clean data points, but also those outliers share the same prototypes in common space, by contrast, the margin value of the latter is non-zero. Motivated by this, in this article, we construct a robust multi-view prototype (RMVP) learning model with auxiliary margin matrices. Specifically, in RMVP, the projection matrices corresponding to each view span the common space to characterize the prototypes, simultaneously. In addition, an auxiliary sparse margin matrix for corresponding view identifies the distance gaps of outliers, whose non-zero column vector represents the margin value. To improve the robustness, the lasso regularization is penalized on the auxiliary matrices. And, an alternating optimization algorithm is presented to solve the proposed model. Finally, extensive experiments are constructed to testify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB  - Pulse oximeter employed in intensive care units and is a crucial equipment employed to measure the vital parameters like heart rate and blood oxygen saturation levels. Using Pulse oximeter, photoplethysmographic (PPG) data is recorded using the PPG sensors attached to the patient is used to estimate oxygen saturation levels. Patient movements while recording the PPG data may result in erroneous estimation of required parameters may result in wrong diagnosis by the clinician. For exact estimation of arterial blood oxygen saturation (SpO2), a clean motion artifacts (MA) reduced is required. MA can be detached from the recorded PPG data using a classical filters, but the in-band noise components cannot be eliminated. In this work, we present a simple technique, multi-scale independent component analysis (MsICA), to reduce MA component present in PPG data. The authors proposed the technique by considering its advantages of MSICA when applied to quasi stationary signals. The superiority of proposed method has been proved by comparing the experimental results with results obtained using Independent component analysis (ICA) method. PPG data recorded with different MA (vertical, horizontal and bending movements of patient's finger) is considered for experiment analysis. Obtained SpO2 parameter computed values proved the effectiveness of the technique in measurement of accurate SpO2, helpful for effective medical diagnosis.

AB  - Power inverters are widely installed to feed the electrical energy from the distributed generation stations into the existing electrical grid. The IGBT-based inverters control the IGBTs, one type of the power semiconducting switches, to form the matched end voltage for the successful power injection. However, the rapid switching with large conducting current of IGBTs results in a large amount of high frequency spikes in the sensor measurement. The presence of the IGBT switching spikes causes the poor operating performance of the inverters and the false detection of the abnormal operating conditions. The present work is devoted to research and development of a new IGBT switching spike identification method to further clean these spikes and preserve any other signal shapes.

AB  - Solar energy is a clean, renewable and sustainable energy source that has the potential of becoming one of the major constituents of the total global energy mix. The achievement of maximum possible photovoltaic (PV) energy conversion requires that the sun's direct beam directly illuminates the photovoltaic panel's surface as long as possible. This can possibly be achieved through solar tracking techniques. Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) based tracking systems face multiple predicaments such as temporary clouding, fog, man-made blockage and others that cause impaired tracking. The objective of this research is to develop an LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) based solar tracker that has the ability to make accurate decisions and ignore faulty sensor readings. To satisfy this objective, Machine Learning techniques are implemented to produce a tracker that has the ability to learn and improve its action from daily interaction with the environment. A Machine Learning based algorithm is developed and implemented in a MATLAB environment. The algorithm has the functionality of continuously testing the consistency of input LDR sensor values, hence making the decision of either approval of the values and usage for further learning or alternatively, discarding of the values and replacing it by a more logical value from the previously learned information. The developed system is tested using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). The system has showed a lowered and converging error response in varying environmental conditions (Sunny, Semi-Cloudy and Cloudy), thus the proposed system has proved its effectiveness in tackling the temporary blockage problem, resulting in a cheap, robust and noise tolerant solar tracking system.

AB  - Pulse signal is prone to corruption with motion artifacts (MA) due to attachment of the sensor to extreme body parts like finger, toes and forehead. This paper compares the performance between two popular statistical signal processing tools, viz., principal component analysis (PCA) with fast independent component analysis (/ICA) in reduction of MA from finger pulse signal collected from 30 human volunteers. A multivariate dataset was generated with systolic peak-aligned Photoplethysmogram (PPG) beats extracted from time series data. After eigenvalues decomposition of the covariance matrix, the original data was reconstructed using the first principal component. The mean correlation coefficient of average beat template of ICA preprocessed data and clean data, averaged over 30 volunteers is 0.9876 while that of PCA preprocessed data with clean data is 0.9778. With white Gaussian noise of known SNR, maximum absolute error for PCA preprocessed data is very small, 3.14% from SNR 25dB onwards. It was also found that beat to beat correlation is higher in the PCA preprocessed data.

In this work, the Monte Carlo filter (MCF)-based MA removal from single-channel ECG signal is proposed, assisting in real-time telecardiology systems. Initially, after R-peak detection and beat extraction, principal component (PC) analysis was performed upon clean ECG beats, and PC, with the highest energy, was assumed to be the feature beat. Using this feature beat, MA corrupted beats were denoised successively to achieve a clean pattern of ECG using MCF. A new approach of weight calculation and resampling was also proposed for better performance of the MCF. Performance of the proposed algorithm was tested on the IEEE Signal Processing Cup Challenge 2015 ECG database and MIT-BIH arrythmia records, with an improvement of signal-to-noise ratio between 10 and 15 dB, after MA removal. The proposed work was also tested on real-time ECG data collected from ten healthy volunteers using the AD8232 ECG module and Raspberry Pi, resulting in correlation coefficient higher than 0.99, between the original and denoised signals. The proposed algorithm was able to remove MA from any single-channel MA corrupted ECG signal, irrespective of lead category, using features of clean beats. A comparative study of the obtained result with previously published works ensured the superior performance on MA removal from ECG in the proposed work, along with real-time data collection, processing, and transmission.

AB  - To enhance the performance of the inertial navigation system (INS)/global position system (GPS) integrated navigation system for the land vehicle during GPS outages is an extremely challenging task. Though existing researches have made reasonable progress in positioning accuracy, they largely ignore sophisticated vehicle stopping events, and the further improvement of positioning performance is urgently needed in complex urban environments. In this article, we propose a heterogeneous multi-task learning (MTL) structure with a shared de-noising process to conduct pseudo-GPS position prediction and zero-velocity detection. The raised model builds upon three vital parts: 1) a shared de-noising convolutional autoencoder (CAE), which can effectively filter the measurement noises in the original inputs and provide more clean data for subsequent calculations without the ground-truth sensor data; 2) a predictor that uses a deep temporal convolutional network (TCN) to predict pseudo-GPS position to bridge GPS gaps; and 3) a robust zero-velocity detector that utilizes a 1-D deep convolutional neural network to accurately detect the vehicle stationary pattern, allowing for timely correcting the velocity and heading. Our proposed MTL model is evaluated on extensive practical road data and achieves a root mean square error of 3.794 m for 120-s GPS outages under long-term vehicle stopping scenarios, which obviously outperforms the stand-alone long short-term memory, TCN, and TCN + CAE. Experimental results also demonstrate that our proposed MTL method yields a remarkable accuracy of over 99.0% for vehicle stationary detection.

AB  - Multi-channel speech enhancement with ad-hoc sensors has been a challenging task. Speech model guided beamforming algorithms are able to recover natural sounding speech, but the speech models tend to be oversimplified or the inference would otherwise be too complicated. On the other hand, deep learning based enhancement approaches are able to learn complicated speech distributions and perform efficient inference, but they are unable to deal with variable number of input channels. Also, deep learning approaches introduce a lot of errors, particularly in the presence of unseen noise types and settings. We have therefore proposed an enhancement framework called DEEPBEAM, which combines the two complementary classes of algorithms. DEEPBEAM introduces a beamforming filter to produce natural sounding speech, but the filter coefficients are determined with the help of a monaural speech enhancement neural network. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data show that Deepbeam is able to produce clean, dry and natural sounding speech, and is robust against unseen noise.

AB  - A low power brushless DC (BLDC) motor drive for domestic flour mill is manifested here. A soft starting based motion sensorless speed control algorithm for BLDC motor fed flour mill is implemented here as the large speed variation is the key challenge for a flour mill application. The implemented sensorless control is tolerant enough to control the current variation in position sensorless mode due to intermittent load variation of the flour mill. The sensorless control used here is insensitive to the switching noise and separate filtration for this not needed. Good rotor position estimation is achieved in wide speed range using the implemented sensorless control. A single DC link current sensor is used for the current control in sensorless starting and load variation. A boost converter based power factor correction is implemented her for maintaining the grid side power quality. The developed sensolress control algorithm is the motor model independent and no parameter estimation is required. The stability and reliability of this system is validated using both simulation and experimental test results.

AB  - Protecting person's face photos from being misused has been an important issue as the rapid development of ubiquitous face sensors. MeshFaces provide a simple and inexpensive way to protect facial photos and have been widely used in China. This paper treats MeshFace generation and removal as a dual learning problem and proposes a high-order relation-preserving CycleGAN framework to solve this problem. First, dual transformations between the distributions of MeshFaces and clean faces in pixel space are learned under the CycleGAN framework, which can efficiently utilize unpaired data. Then, a novel High-order Relation-preserving (HR) loss is imposed on CycleGAN to recover the finer texture details and generate much sharper images. Different from the L1 and L2 losses that result in image smoothness and blurry, the HR loss can better capture the appearance variation of MeshFaces and hence facilitates removal. Moreover, Identity Preserving loss is proposed to preserve both global and local identity information. Experimental results on three databases demonstrate that our approach is highly effective for MeshFace generation and removal.

AB  - With the rapid development of clean energy generation technology, a large number of distributed power sources are integrated into the local power grid, resulting in the intensification of disturbance signals in the power grid. It is particularly important to effectively classify and identify the disturbance signals in the power grid. This paper presents a recognition method based on energy difference and support vector machine. The method extracts signal feature vectors by calculating the energy difference of power grid signals and sends them to support vector machine for classification. Experiments were carried out on the power grid signals with and without noise. Experiments show that this method can effectively classify and recognize the disturbance signals, and the recognition rate is greatly improved. The effectiveness of the method is proved. This paper provides a theoretical basis for the improvement of power grid quality and intelligent monitoring management in the future.

AB  - Recent years have witnessed researchers paying enormous attention to design efficient multi-modal biometric systems because of their ability to withstand spoof attacks. Single biometric sometimes fails to extract adequate information for verifying the identity of a person [7]. On the other hand, by combining multiple modalities, enhanced performance reliability could be achieved. In this paper, we have fused face and palmprint modalities at all levels of fusion viz sensor level, feature level, decision level and score level. For this purpose, we have selected modality specific feature extraction algorithms for face and palmprint such as LDA and LPQ respectively. Popular databases AR (for face) and PolyU (for Palmprint) were considered for evaluation purposes. Rigorous experiments were conducted both under clean and noisy conditions to ascertain robust level of fusion and impact of fusion strategies at various levels of fusion for these two modalities. Results are substantiated with appropriate analysis.

AB  - T-Wave alternans (TWA) is a cardiac phenomenon regarded as an index of high risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD). Although a number of methods have been proposed for TWA detection, their final decision always fully depends on one single lead which is usually picked out for its strongest TWA detection result among all the other leads. That is to say that lots of useful information have been unused and wasted. To our best knowledge, no method that fuses TWA detection results independently obtained by each lead to do comprehensive decision has been introduced. In this paper, a novel multi-lead method for TWA fusion detection is proposed. This method combines Dezert-Smarandache theory (DSmT) with Laplacian likelihood ratio method (LLR) to gain higher detection rate. The proposed method was evaluated and compared with standard LLR method by means of a simulation study, in which extracted TWA waveform and clean background ECG from real records were used to synthetize simulated data with different types of simulated or physiological noises. These methods were also applied to real records from PTB Diagnostic ECG Database. The results are presented by constructing receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curves. All test results show that the proposed method has a larger margin of separability and higher detection rate than traditional methods. A more accurate and robust TWA detection method has great value to predict the risk of sudden cardiac death(SCD).

AB  - This paper focuses on the stability control algorithm for four-wheel independent steering (4WIS) and four-wheel independent drive (4WID) electric vehicle (EV) with the coordinated control of four-wheel steering (4WS) and direct yaw-moment control (DYC) techniques. In order to design an adaptive gain-scheduled robust controller for stability control, linear parameter-varying (LPV) system and H∞ optimal control theory are applied. The polytopic model is proposed to build the LPV system for 4WIS-4WID EV. Taking structured uncertainties and sensor noise into consideration, gain-scheduled robust controller is designed and worked out using linear matrix inequality (LMI). To verify the performance of the adaptive gain-scheduled robust controller, fishhook maneuver and sinusoidal steering maneuver are carried out based on hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) tests. Test results indicate that the adaptive gain-scheduled robust controller can improve vehicle's handling stability especially in extreme conditions. Meanwhile, the designed controller shows strong robustness to suppress system parametric perturbation.

AB  - Probabilistic queries have been extensively explored to provide answers with confidence, in order to support the real-life applications struggling with uncertain data, such as sensor networks and data integration. However, the uncertainty of data may propagate, and thus, the results returned by probabilistic queries contain much noise, which degrades query quality significantly. In this paper, we propose an efficient optimization framework, termed as QueryClean, for both probabilistic skyline computation and probabilistic similarity search. The goal of QueryClean is to optimize query quality via selecting a group of uncertain objects to clean under limited resource available, where a joint-entropy based quality function is leveraged. We develop an efficient structure called ASI to index the possible result sets of probabilistic queries, which helps to avoid many types of probabilistic query evaluations over a large number of the possible worlds for quality computation. Moreover, we present exact and approximate algorithms for the optimization problem, using two newly presented heuristics. Considerable experimental results on both real and synthetic data sets demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of our proposed framework QueryClean.

AB  - Most pulse oximeters determine blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) after calculating a coefficient, R, that represents the normalized ratiometric contributions of the pulsatile red and near-infrared photoplethysmograms (PPGs) acquired by the sensor. This paper presents a new approach that uses principle component analysis (PCA) to separate the signal and noise components of unfiltered PPGs and provide the determination of R. Also, rather than use peak-to-valley time intervals to obtain R, this technique uses eigenvalue and eigenvector data obtained during PCA to optimize these time intervals and improve the R calculation. Early analyses on unfiltered PPGs from 16 subjects indicate that these R values compare to those obtained from FFT-based methods and yield SpO2 values consistent with those reported by a commercial unit. All signal data are considered during the PCA process, so this technique shows promise to precisely segment clean versus noise-corrupted PPGs.

AB  - A versatile three-terminal test cell is described that permits accurate determination of the relative permittivity and loss factor of liquids. The cell takes a small charge, complies with IEC publication 247, and is particularly easy to dismantle, clean, and use. it is simple to set up because its housing fits directly into the opening in a commercial oil bath. Electrode and sample temperatures are accurately monitored with thermocouples and a platinum resistance thermometer, none of which introduces electrical noise into the measuring system. With direct injection, relative permittivity measurements can be made to within +or-0.00006%, this being twice the uncertainty in the air capacitance of the cell. The cell and its contents can be heated at a variety of rates, which makes it ideal for studying temperature-dependent loss in insulating liquids. Experimental results on a silicon fluid and high-voltage cable oil are included.<>

We present the design, finite-element simulations, and experimental characterization of a fast custom-built short-range scanner. The short-range scanner is based on electromagnetic actuation to provide high linearity, has a clean, high-bandwidth dynamical response and is equipped with a low-noise magnetoresistance-based sensor. By using advanced noise-resilient feedback controllers, the dual-stage system allows large-range positioning with subnanometer closed-loop resolution over a wide bandwidth. Experimental results are presented in which the dual-stage scanner system is used for imaging in a custom-built atomic force microscope.

AB  - In this work, various linear predictive feature vectors were used to train three different automated neural networks type classifiers for the task of isolated vowel recognition. The features used included linear prediction filter coefficients, reflection coefficients, log area ratios, and the linear predictive cepstrum. The three neural network classifiers used are the multilayer perceptron, radial basis function and the probabilistic neural network. The linear predictive cepstrum of dimension 12 is the best feature especially when training is done on clean speech and testing is done on noisy speech. Three different classifier fusion strategies (linear fusion, majority voting and weighted majority voting) were found to improve the performance. Linear fusion with varying weights is the best method and is most robust to noise.

AB  - This article proposes a novel approach to replace the fixed projection planes existed in the previous researches to reduce motion artifacts obtained from the human face by a normal webcam for monitoring heart rate in a real-time fashion. The novel projection plane is adaptively changed with the light intensity change to eliminate the color distortion induced by motion. In this article, the state-of-the-art semantic segmentation Deeplabv3+ is implemented to segment the skin pixels from the facial region that is detected by several trackers (Boosting, MIL, TLD, Median Flow, Mosse, and CSRT) to boost the computational time compared to the conventional face detection by Haar-Like features. Image and digital signal processing techniques are also applied to eliminate possible noise for obtaining a clean pulse signal. The proposed approach is compared with other existing approaches (Green, PCA, Chrom, and POS) in multiple challenges. From the experiments conducted, the Deeplabv3+ outperforms the conventional K-means for different kinds of skin segmentation. Moreover, the proposed approach is quite robust and stable in the stationary case (with the accuracy 96%), dim-lighting environment and the long-distance up to 4-m away without zooming in camera. Besides, multiple head-movement simulations and motions of fitness are conquered by the APP approach as shown in the experiments. Thus, it can be concluded that the proposed approach is applicable to surveillance or healthcare applications.

AB  - Objective: The wearable and portable Electroencephalogram (EEG) sensing systems are deeply interfered by unavoidable physiological artifacts due to the limited recording resources. In this work, an intelligent artifact removal system that handles single-channel EEG signals in the presence of mixed multi-type artifacts is investigated. Methods: The basic idea is to represent the mixed artifacts in contaminated varying EEG signals with the unchanged latent pattern features, and then employ the adaptive artifact removal scheme to separate the contamination and clean EEG signals in the encoded feature domain. To minimize the risks of corrupting clean signals and keeping artifacts by mistake, the artifact removal is formulated as an identification-removal two-stage minimization problem, and an attention based adaptive feature concentration mechanism is designed to improve the removal utility and reduce the calculation consumption. Results: In the real implementation on open real-world dataset, this study achieves the artifact identification accuracy of 98.52% and average correlation coefficient of 0.73 for the removal of strong mixed multi-type artifacts. Conclusion: This study can deal with single-channel EEG signals contaminated by mixed multi-type artifacts with high accuracy and low overhead, and is more effective and stable than traditional schemes with fixed criteria. Significance: This study can significantly improve the signal quality acquired by simplified EEG sensing systems, and may extend the application of wearable and portable EEG sensing systems to medical diagnosis, cognitive science research and other applications requiring clinical setups.

AB  - In this paper, we compare satellite-borne Cand X-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data for marine oil spill observation. During large-scale oil-on-water exercises in the North Sea, quad-polarization Radarsat-2 (C-band) and dual-polarization TerraSAR-X (X-band) data were acquired with temporal distances of less than 24 min. The objective is to characterize and quantify differences in the Radarsat-2 and TerraSAR-X measurements. Three scene pairs are compared in terms of data quality and signal characteristics, including statistical properties and selected multipolarization (HH, VV) parameters. The signal characteristics are also compared among low-backscatter features of various origin within the individual pairs. No viable argument for selecting one sensor above the other is identified in the data quality study. In the statistical analysis, investigation of logcumulants indicates a larger deviation from Gaussian statistics in the TerraSAR-X data compared with Radarsat-2 measurements. Log-cumulant diagrams are also shown to be a useful tool for discrimination between oil spills and a simulated biogenic slick in both sensors. Multipolarization features show enhanced slick-sea contrasts and a better discrimination between mineral oil spills and other low-backscatter features in Radarsat-2 compared with TerraSAR-X. The presence of a non-Bragg scattering component in the data is revealed for both sensors. The relative contribution of non-Bragg scattering to the total backscatter is found to be higher in the TerraSAR-X data than in the Radarsat-2 data. In general, the non-Bragg component is found to account for a larger part of the backscatter in slick-covered areas compared with clean sea.

AB  - Striping effects are a common phenomenon in remote-sensing imaging systems, and they can exhibit considerable differences between different sensors. Such artifacts can greatly degrade the quality of the measured data and further limit the subsequent applications in higher level remote-sensing products. Although a lot of destriping methods have been proposed to date, a few of them are robust to different types of stripes. In this paper, we conduct a thorough feature analysis of stripe noise from a novel perspective. With regard to the problem of striping diversity and complexity, we propose a universal destriping framework. In the proposed destriping procedure, a 1-D variational method is first designed and utilized to estimate the statistical feature-based guidance. The guidance information is then incorporated into 2-D optimization to control the image estimation for a reliable and clean output. The iteratively reweighted least-squares method and alternating direction method of multipliers are exploited in the proposed approach to solve the minimization problems. Experiments under various cases of simulated and real stripes confirm the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed model in terms of the qualitative and quantitative comparisons with other approaches.

AB  - Reliable visual features that encode the articulator movements of speakers can dramatically improve the decoding accuracy of automatic speech recognition systems when combined with the corresponding acoustic signals. In this paper, a novel framework is proposed to utilize audio-visual speech not only during decoding but also for training better acoustic models. In this framework, a multi-stream hidden Markov model is iteratively deployed to fuse audio and video likelihoods. The fused likelihoods are used to estimate enhanced frame-state alignments, which are finally used as better training targets. The proposed framework is so flexible that it can be partially used to train acoustic models with the available audio-visual data while a conventional training strategy can be followed with the remaining acoustic data. The experimental results show that the acoustic models trained using the proposed audio-visual framework perform significantly better than those trained conventionally with solely acoustic data in clean and noisy conditions.

AB  - The traditional denoising methods in noise robust synthetic aperture radar (SAR) automatic target recognition research are independent of the recognition model, which limits the robust recognition performance. In this article, we present a robust SAR automatic target recognition method via adversarial learning, which could integrate data denoising, feature extraction, and classification into a unified framework for joint learning. Different from the common recognition methods of directly inputting the SAR data into the classifiers, we add a dual-generative-adversarial-network (GAN) model between the SAR data and the classifier for data translation from a noise-polluted style to a relatively clean style to reduce the noise from SAR data. In order to ensure the target information in the SAR data can be retained during the data style translation, reconstruction constraint and label constraint are also used in the dual-GAN model. Then, the more reliable transferred SAR data are fed into the classifier. The parameters of the dual-GAN and classifier are learned through joint optimization in our method. Thus, the data separability is guaranteed in the process of denoising and feature extraction, which greatly improves the recognition performance of the method. In addition, our method can be easily extended to a semisupervised method by using different objective functions for labeled and unlabeled training data, which is more suitable for practical application. Experimental results on MSTAR dataset and Gotcha dataset show that our method can get the encouraging performance in the case of low signal-to-noise ratio and small labeled data size.

AB  - Free space estimation is an important problem for autonomous robot navigation. Traditional camera-based approaches train a segmentation model using an annotated dataset. The training data needs to capture the wide variety of environments and weather conditions encountered at runtime, making the annotation cost prohibitively high. In this work, we propose a novel approach for obtaining free space estimates from images taken with a single road-facing camera. We rely on a technique that generates weak free space labels without any supervision, which are then used as ground truth to train a segmentation model for free space estimation. Our work differs from prior attempts by explicitly taking label noise into account through the use of Co-Teaching. Since Co-Teaching has traditionally been investigated in classification tasks, we adapt it for segmentation and examine how its parameters affect performances in our experiments. In addition, we propose Stochastic Co-Teaching, which is a novel method to select clean samples that leads to enhanced results. We achieve an IoU of 82.6%, a Precision of 90.9%, and a Recall of 90.3%. Our best model reaches 87% of the IoU, 93% of the Precision, and 93% of the Recall of the equivalent fully-supervised baseline while using no human annotations. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to use Co-Teaching to train a free space segmentation model under explicit label noise. Our implementation and models are freely available online.

AB  - Due to the presence of motion artifacts (MAs), heart rate monitoring using PPG sensors in daily life and physical exercise is challenging, and there have been many studies on MA removal algorithms. However, most studies do not consider the quality evaluation of PPG signal before the MA removal. In this way, removing the MA directly regardless of whether there is motion artifact signal is not only a waste of computing resources, but also easy to introduce new noise. In this paper, the MA detection in PPG signal is performed by dividing the original signal into 6s signal segments and calculating the amplitude mean difference function (AMDF). Then the obtained AMDF is converted into a 2-D image through the Gramian Angular Field (GAF), and then classified by the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) classifier, so as to distinguish the contaminated signal and clean signal. In the subsequent processing, only the contaminated signal needs to remove the MAs, and the clean signal segment can be directly used for heart rate estimation. In this study, we achieve a classification accuracy of 0.966 in the local database, and a classification accuracy of 0.946 in the BIDMC PPG and Respiration Dataset published by PhysioNet. With the combination of feature extraction and SVM classifier, the proposed method has significantly improved the results.

AB  - Deep learning has shown a strong potential in device-free human activity recognition (HAR). However, a fundamental challenge is ensuring accuracy, without re-training, when exposing a previously trained architecture to a new or unseen environment. To overcome the aforementioned challenge, this paper proposes an environment-robust channel state information (CSI) based HAR by leveraging the properties of a matching network (MatNet) and enhanced features (HAR-MN-EF). To improve the CSI quality, we propose a CSI cleaning and enhancement method (CSI-CE) that includes two key stages: activity-related information extraction (ARIE) and correlation feature extraction based on principal component analysis (CFE-PCA). The ARIE stage is able to effectively enhance the activity-dependent features whilst mitigating behavior-unrelated information. The CFE-PCA stage further improves the extracted features by filtering out the residual activity-unrelated data and the residual noise contained in signals from the former stage. The extracted features are then sequenced into the MatNet to create an environment-robust HAR. Experimental results confirm that an architecture trained by the proposed HAR-MN-EF can be directly adapted to a new environment, achieving reliable sensing accuracies without requiring additional effort.

AB  - Modular Multilevel Converters (MMCs) have become one of the most popular power converters for medium/high power applications, from transmission systems to motor drives. However, to operate properly, MMCs require a considerable number of sensors and communication of sensitive data to a central controller, all under relevant electromagnetic interference produced by the high frequency switching of power semiconductors. This work explores the use of neural networks (NNs) to support the operation of MMCs by: i) denoising measurements, such as stack currents, using a blind autoencoder NN; and ii) estimating the sub-module capacitor voltages, using an encoder-decoder NN. Experimental results obtained with data from a three-phase MMC show that NNs can effectively clean sensor measurements and estimate internal states of the converter accurately, even during transients, drastically reducing sensing and communication requirements.

AB  - Electroencephalography has an important role in diagnoses of various brain disorders. Among these disorders, Epilepsy is the most common as 1% of world population is suffering from it. Being a neuroimaging technique, EEG is utilized in testing epilepsy (or seizures) while mapping the neural activity of the brain. EEG not only measures the electrical activity and continuous cortical changes with better time resolution but it also investigates the known or predicted seizures or epilepsy issues in the normal and abnormal subjects. The objective of this paper is to investigate the seizures, spikes or predicted epilepsy issues and their source localization in the suspected epilepsy subject while sleeping in the night. In the results, it is found that several sharp spikes or seizures are found in the entire EEG data particularly in the frontal sensory part of the brain. In order to investigate the seizures or spikes and their source localization, the EEG epileptic suspected data is firstly cleaned from the noises, and artifacts and other unwanted harmonics. This requires several pre-processing steps for such as cleaning, averaging, referencing, filtering, epoching and coupling the anatomical structure with the sensors and improving signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The analysis shows that left fronto-central part of the brain with the high amplitudes at the position of the electrodes (FC1, Cz) carries the sharp waves, poly-spikes and bursts of beta band activity especially during the sleep of the patient. This area is also located with the fixing goodness value above than 95% in a given time slot.

AB  - Point cloud segmentation is a fundamental task in 3D. Despite recent progress on point cloud segmentation with the power of deep networks, current deep learning methods based on the clean label assumptions may fail with noisy labels. Yet, object class labels are often mislabeled in real-world point cloud datasets. In this work, we take the lead in solving this issue by proposing a novel Point Noise-Adaptive Learning (PNAL) framework. Compared to existing noise-robust methods on image tasks, our PNAL is noise-rate blind, to cope with the spatially variant noise rate problem specific to point clouds . Specifically, we propose a novel point-wise confidence selection to obtain reliable labels based on the historical predictions of each point. A novel cluster-wise label correction is proposed with a voting strategy to generate the best possible label taking the neighbor point correlations into consideration. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of PNAL on both synthetic and real-world noisy datasets. In particular, even with 60% symmetric noisy labels, our proposed method produces much better results than its baseline counterpart without PNAL and is comparable to the ideal upper bound trained on a completely clean dataset. Moreover, we fully re-labeled the validation set of a popular but noisy real-world scene dataset ScanNetV2 to make it clean, for rigorous experiment and future research. Our code and data will be released.

HiPerSAT uses BLAS, LAPACK, MPI and OpenMP to achieve a high performance solution that exploits parallel hardware. ICA is a class of methods for analyzing a large set of data samples and extracting independent components that explain the observed data. ICA is used in EEG research for data cleaning and separation of spatiotemporal patterns that may reflect different underlying neural processes. We present two ICA implementations (FastICA and Info-max) that exploit parallelism to provide an EEG component decomposition solution of higher performance and data capacity than current MATLAB-based implementations. Experimental results and the methodology used to obtain them are presented. Integrating HiPerSAT with EEGLAB (A. Delorme and S. Makeig, 2004) is described, as well as future plans for this research.

AB  - Target motion analysis (TMA) with wideband passive sonar has received much attention. Maximum likelihood probabilistic data association (ML-PDA) represents an asymptotically efficient estimator for deterministic target motion, and is especially well suited for low-observable targets; the results presented here apply to situations with higher signal-to-noise ratio as well, including of course the situation of a deterministic target observed via “clean” measurements without false alarms or missed detections. Here we study the inverse problem, namely, how to identify the observing platform (following a “two-leg” motion model) from the results of the target estimation process, i.e., the estimated target state and the Fisher information matrix (FIM), quantities we assume an eavesdropper might intercept. We tackle the problem and we present observability properties, with supporting simulation results.

AB  - Seismicity-related anomaly analysis or earthquake precursor cognition is a great challenge for geo-electromagnetic signals mining and remote sensing application. To mining seismic anomaly from satellite data including microwave data is of extreme importance. A spatio-temporally weighted two-step method (STW-TSM) is developed to retrieve or to mine seismicity-related microwave brightness temperature (MBT) anomaly with microwave satellite big data from Aqua AMSR-E and/or FY-3B MWRI sensors. To remove the general trend of MBT to retrieve basic MBT residuals of the shocking year, historical microwave data were given varied time-weights according to respective time intervals with the shocking year. To eliminate the regional meteorological noise so as to retrieve cleaned MBT residuals actually related with seismic activities, adjacent pixels inside the seismic preparation zone were endowed with varied space-weights according to Euclidean distances away from the epicenter With Wenchuan earthquake sequence in May, 2008 and Nepal earthquake sequence in April and May, 2015 being case studies, this paper demonstrated the practical application of STW-TSM. Results showed that 1) significant strip-shaped MBT anomalies appeared near the epicenter of Wenchuan earthquake days before the main shocking and migrated with aftershocks moving northeastward 2) the horizontal strip MBT anomalies covered exactly the epicenters and seismic concentration zone of Nepal earthquakes during shocking days 3) the MBT anomaly zones behaved highly spatial overlap with geological quaternary strata and cliff-shaped mountainous region. The mined MBT anomalies are supposed to be related with the effects of rock dielectric constant variation, which is most likely to be caused by crust stress activated positive electricity carriers from deep crustal. This research is of particular meanings for mining MBT anomaly from satellite microwave big data, and for searching geo-electromagnetic signals related with seismicity.

AB  - Scene depth variation is an important factor that leads to spatially-varying camera motion blur. Most of the previous methods require auxiliary cameras or user interaction to make depth-aware deblurring tractable. In this work, we propose to use a noisy/blurred/noisy image sequence and simultaneously recorded inertial measurements to jointly estimate scene depth and remove spatially-varying blur caused by depth variation and camera in-plane motion. The inertial data could provide initialization of camera motion parameters, while the noisy image pair preserve large-scale sharp edges from which a coarse disparity map can be generated. However, this initial estimate is not accurate enough to produce a high-quality clean image. Therefore, we develop an optimization scheme to refine depth, motion parameters and latent image alternately. A Markov Random Field (MRF) framework is formulated to solve for the depth map by exploiting both stereo cues and motion blur cues and the residual Richardson-Lucy algorithm is used to effectively suppress deconvolution ringing artifacts. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach can address both depth estimation as well as image deblurring.

AB  - Single-view depth prediction is a fundamental problem in computer vision. Recently, deep learning methods have led to significant progress, but such methods are limited by the available training data. Current datasets based on 3D sensors have key limitations, including indoor-only images (NYU), small numbers of training examples (Make3D), and sparse sampling (KITTI). We propose to use multi-view Internet photo collections, a virtually unlimited data source, to generate training data via modern structure-from-motion and multi-view stereo (MVS) methods, and present a large depth dataset called MegaDepth based on this idea. Data derived from MVS comes with its own challenges, including noise and unreconstructable objects. We address these challenges with new data cleaning methods, as well as automatically augmenting our data with ordinal depth relations generated using semantic segmentation. We validate the use of large amounts of Internet data by showing that models trained on MegaDepth exhibit strong generalization-not only to novel scenes, but also to other diverse datasets including Make3D, KITTI, and DIW, even when no images from those datasets are seen during training.

AB  - The analysis of public transportation data is receiving an increasing amount of attention from the research community in the past few years. This interest is fueled by the widespread installation and open access to a variety of sensor technologies for collecting data on the state of the transport system in many cities around the world. Different cities provide different data sources and in many cases the only common dataset is represented by GPS data of the vehicle fleet. Very often, the data contain erroneous or missing information that should be corrected before proceeding with their analysis. In this paper, we propose a methodology to de-noise scheduled bus stops and detect time schedule information using GPS AVL (Automatic Vehicle Location) data. The methodology performs different sequential steps: i) cleaning process and detection of trips; ii) bus stop extraction; ii) bus stop clustering; iv) feature extraction; v) classification model construction and application. Moreover, the impact on the whole process of different methods applied in different steps is empirically evaluated on datasets with different temporal extent.

AB  - This paper presents a novel approach to tracking dynamic objects in 3D range data. Its key contribution lies in the generative object detection algorithm which allows the tracker to robustly extract objects of varying sizes and shapes from the observations. In contrast to tracking methods using discriminative detectors, we are thus able to generalize over a wide range of object classes matching our assumptions. Whilst the generative model underlying our framework inherently scales with the complexity and the noise characteristics of the environment, all parameters involved in the detection process obey a clean probabilistic interpretation. Nevertheless, our unsupervised object detection and tracking algorithm achieves real-time performance, even in highly dynamic scenarios covering a significant amount of moving objects. Through an application to populated urban settings, we are able to show that the tracking performance of the presented approach yields results which are comparable to state-of-the-art discriminative methods.

AB  - The structure of the cumulative food intake (CFI) curve has been associated with obesity and eating disorders. Scales that record the weight loss of a plate from which a subject eats food are used for capturing this curve; however, their measurements are contaminated by additive noise and are distorted by certain types of artifacts. This paper presents an algorithm for automatically processing continuous in-meal weight measurements in order to extract the clean CFI curve and in-meal eating indicators, such as total food intake and food intake rate. The algorithm relies on the representation of the weight-time series by a string of symbols that correspond to events such as bites or food additions. A context-free grammar is next used to model a meal as a sequence of such events. The selection of the most likely parse tree is finally used to determine the predicted eating sequence. The algorithm is evaluated on a dataset of 113 meals collected using the Mandometer, a scale that continuously samples plate weight during eating. We evaluate the effectiveness for seven indicators and for bite-instance detection. We compare our approach with three state-of-the-art algorithms, and achieve the lowest error rates for most indicators (24 g for total meal weight). The proposed algorithm extracts the parameters of the CFI curve automatically, eliminating the need for manual data processing, and thus facilitating large-scale studies of eating behavior.

AB  - There are various types and distributions of noise in hyperspectral images. However, the existing classification models are vulnerable to noise in the data. To improve the robustness of the classification models, a novel hyperspectral image classification model is proposed, named triple-regularized latent subspace discriminative regression (TRLSDR). The core idea of TRLSDR is to add a latent subspace to the standard discriminative least squares regression model to extract high-order features from the visual space by undercomplete autoencoder, and then use clean data for classification. Three regularizers are introduced in this process: Tikhonov regularizer is used to avoid overfitting; Laplacian regularizer is used to capture the neighborhood relationship; and low-rank regularizer is used to alleviate the error of Laplacian matrix construction caused by noise in original samples. We designed experiments on five hyperspectral image datasets and the results show that the proposed model is superior to the existing regression models.

AB  - This paper introduces a wearable Tele-ECG and heart rate (HR) monitoring system which has a novel architecture including a stretchable singlet redesigned with textile electrodes (TEs), textile threads, snap fasteners, Velcro, sponges, and an ECG circuit. In addition, a Bluetooth low energy (BLE), a smartphone, a server, and a web page have been added to the system for remote monitoring. The TE can be attached to and removed from the singlet by a Velcro, which allows the user to dry-clean the TE easily for long-term use. A new holter-based ECG system has been designed to evaluate the TE-based ECG system and the average correlation between the recorded ECG signals is obtained as 99.23%. A filtered digital signal, with a high signal-to-noise ratio of 45.62 dB, is transmitted to the smartphone via BLE. The ECG signal is plotted, the HR is calculated with 1.83% mean absolute percentage error, and displayed. The data are sent to the server, allowing the patient's physician to analyze the signals in real time through the web page or the smartphone. If HR reaches beyond the normal range or user presses the “HELP” button on the smartphone screen, the physician is informed automatically by an short message service (SMS) with a location pin on the map. The battery lasts approximately 14 days and when it needs replacement, the system automatically alerts the users by an SMS and a flashing LED. This fast and uninterrupted telemonitoring system has the potential to improve the patient's life quality by providing a psychological reassurance.

AB  - Image is one of the most important part of multi-media that is used in several areas from simple photography to medical and satellite imaging. In each field its usage and requirements are very different. So, an image required to be clean and free from artifacts to convey better information. But, acquisition is always associated with some sort of degradation that may be due to atmospheric conditions, camera sensors and/or lighting conditions. In this paper we are considering the degradation only due to noise and in specific additive Gaussian noise. Here, we are proposing to use a dual step approach for denoising. In the first step it uses stationary wavelet based denoising and in continuation to second step, a spatial domain method, Non-local means, is used to remove the artifacts. The simulation is done on both real and synthetic images and it shows an improvement over existing methods.

AB  - This paper reviews the second challenge on spectral reconstruction from RGB images, i.e., the recovery of whole- scene hyperspectral (HS) information from a 3-channel RGB image. As in the previous challenge, two tracks were provided: (i) a "Clean" track where HS images are estimated from noise-free RGBs, the RGB images are themselves calculated numerically using the ground-truth HS images and supplied spectral sensitivity functions (ii) a "Real World" track, simulating capture by an uncalibrated and unknown camera, where the HS images are recovered from noisy JPEG-compressed RGB images. A new, larger-than-ever, natural hyperspectral image data set is presented, containing a total of 510 HS images. The Clean and Real World tracks had 103 and 78 registered participants respectively, with 14 teams competing in the final testing phase. A description of the proposed methods, alongside their challenge scores and an extensive evaluation of top performing methods is also provided. They gauge the state-of-the-art in spectral reconstruction from an RGB image.

AB  - Deep neural networks (DNNs) appear to be a solution for the classification of polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) data in that they outperform classical supervised classifiers under the condition of sufficient training samples. The design of a classifier is challenging because DNNs can easily overfit due to limited remote sensing training samples and unavoidable noisy labels. In this article, a softmax loss strategy with antinoise capability, namely, the probability-aware sample grading strategy (PASGS), is developed to overcome this limitation. Combined with the proposed softmax loss strategy, two classical DNN-based classifiers are implemented to perform PolSAR image classification to demonstrate its effectiveness. In this framework, the difference distribution implicitly reflects the probability that a training sample is clean, and clean labels can be distinguished from noisy labels according to the method of probability statistics. Then, this probability is employed to reweight the corresponding loss of each training sample during the training process to locate the noisy data and to prevent participation in the loss calculation of the neural network. As the number of training iterations increases, the condition of the probability statistics of the noisy labels will be constantly adjusted without supervision, and the clean labels will eventually be identified to train the neural network. Experiments on three PolSAR datasets with two DNN-based methods also demonstrate that the proposed method is superior to state-of-the-art methods.

AB  - The problems of recovering the state of power systems and detecting the instances of bad data have been widely studied in literature. Nevertheless, these two operations have been designed and optimized for the most part in isolation. Specifically, state estimators are optimized based on the minimum mean-square error criteria, which is only optimal when the source of distortions in the data is Gaussian random noise. Hence, the state estimators fail to perform optimality when the data is further contaminated by bad data, which cannot necessarily be modeled by additive Gaussian terms. The problem of power state estimation has been studied extensively. But the fundamental performance limits and the attendant decision rules are unknown when the data is potentially compromised by random bad data (due to sensor failures) or structured bad data (due to cyber attacks, which are also referred to false data injection attacks). This paper provides a general framework that formalizes the underlying connection between state estimation and bad data detection routines. We aim to carry out the combined tasks of detecting the presence of random and structured bad data, and form accurate estimations for the state of power grid. This paper characterizes the optimal detectors and estimators. Furthermore, the gains with respect to the existing state estimators and bad data detectors are established through numerical evaluations.

The problem of speech signal reconstruction is formulated based on CS utilizing Basis Pursuit (BP) and Compressive Sampling Matching Pursuit (CoSaMP) algorithms. Furthermore, direct sparsity estimation is adopted to efficiently find the sparsity level. Ultimately, it is demonstrated that roughly both of methods are effective in reconstructing the signal of interest with high probability. In addition, the average output frame-based SNRs and the perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ) of subjective listening quality (LQ) and objective quality score for each method are compared.

AB  - Several end-to-end deep learning approaches have been recently presented which extract either audio or visual features from the input images or audio signals and perform speech recognition. However, research on end-to-end audiovisual models is very limited. In this work, we present an end-to-end audiovisual model based on residual networks and Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Units (BGRUs). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first audiovisual fusion model which simultaneously learns to extract features directly from the image pixels and audio waveforms and performs within-context word recognition on a large publicly available dataset (LRW). The model consists of two streams, one for each modality, which extract features directly from mouth regions and raw waveforms. The temporal dynamics in each stream/modality are modeled by a 2-layer BGRU and the fusion of multiple streams/modalities takes place via another 2-layer BGRU. A slight improvement in the classification rate over an end-to-end audio-only and MFCC-based model is reported in clean audio conditions and low levels of noise. In presence of high levels of noise, the end-to-end audiovisual model significantly outperforms both audio-only models.

AB  - Several challenges are encountered while integrating microgrids (MGs) with an existing utility grid. These are low inertia, intermittent nature of renewable energy resources (RESs), sensor/actuator faults, unbalanced and nonlinear loads, supply-demand mismatch, and uncertain switching functions of the power electronic converter. MG control is fully dependent on the communication network, which is also susceptible to different types of failures such as noise in communication links, communication delay, limited bandwidth, packet dropout, and various malicious cyber attacks. Very few papers are available in the literature that focus on the review of control schemes for MG. Consequently, this paper presents a comprehensive review of different robust and adaptive control schemes that address the challenges encountered due to communication constraints, uncertainties, and disturbances for different MG topologies such as AC, DC, and hybrid AC/DC MG, as well as the current research trends in the field of robust and adaptive control. It can be concluded that to achieve control objectives of MG and overcome the existing challenges, robust and adaptive controllers show significantly improved performance in terms of transient and steady-state behavior and robustness as compared to traditional controllers.

AB  - This paper introduces a magnetic-free object transport system driven by a friction force on an ultrasonic flexural vibrating beam. This driving mechanism offers unique advantages of silent operation and lubricant-free structure. The characteristics are ideal for a transport system in a clean-room environment. However, the friction drive described by Hertzian contact and Coulomb friction theories is highly nonlinear. The transport system needs a sophisticated control design to deliver a load to a precise location. A traditional feedback controller and sliding-mode control were implemented in the presence of sensor noise and hardware limitation. It is experimentally shown that the tracking performance of the proposed control scheme is superior to the traditional control design.

AB  - In Passive Bistatic Radar (PBR) a local communications transmitter is used as an illuminator. A Line Of Sight (LOS) signal is captured to use as a template for radar processing. This may be cleaned via demodulation and remodulation, removing short-delay copies and sensor noise. However differences between the transmitter clock and local clock cause the remodulated signal to be mismatched to the transmitted signal, causing degradation of delay-Doppler processing output. This study presents a model which captures the effect of clock disparity upon remodulated OFDM signals. The model is used in simulation to illustrate the specific effect of clock offsets on PBR by examination of delay-Doppler output. It is shown that modification of the template to account for time-varying clock offsets can restore the delay-Doppler output to be nearly ideal.

AB  - Recently, deep neural network (DNN) based methods for low-dose CT have been investigated to achieve excellent performance in both image quality and computational speed. However, almost all methods using DNNs for low-dose CT require clean ground truth data with full radiation dose to train the DNNs. In this work, we attempt to train DNNs for low-dose CT reconstructions with reduced tube current by investigating unsupervised training of DNNs for denoising sensor measurements or sinograms without full-dose ground truth images. In other words, our proposed methods allow training of DNNs with only noisy low-dose CT measurements. First, the Poisson Unbiased Risk Estimator (PURE) is investigated to train a DNN for denoising CT measurements, and a method is proposed for reconstructing the CT image using filtered back-projection (FBP) and the DNN trained with PURE. Then, the CT forward model-based Weighted Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimator (WSURE) is proposed to train a DNN for denoising CT sinograms and to subsequently reconstruct the CT image using FBP. Our proposed methods achieve excellent performance in both fast computation and reconstructed image quality, which is more comparable to the results of the DNNs trained with full-dose ground truth data than other state-of-the-art denoising methods such as the BM3D, Deep Image Prior, and Deep Decoder.

AB  - This article considers the inverse problem under hyperspectral images (HSIs) denoising framework. Recently, it has been shown that deep learning is a promising approach to image denoising. However, deep learning to be effective usually needs a massive amount of training data. Moreover, in a practical scenario, HSIs may get contaminated by different kinds of noises such as Gaussian and/or sparse noise. Lately, it has been reported that the convolutional neural network (CNN), the core element used by deep image prior (DIP), is able to capture image statistical characteristics without the need of training, i.e., restore the clean image blindly. Nonetheless, there exists some performance gap between DIP and state-of-the-art methods in HSIs (e.g., low-rank models). By applying the Huber loss function (HLF), which is derived through a least favorable distribution in robust statistics, to DIP, we propose a novel unsupervised denoising algorithm, referred as to the HLF-DIP, free from pretraining and without involving any regularizer. Extensive experimental results are provided to demonstrate that the proposed HLF-DIP algorithm significantly outperforms seven state-of-the-art algorithms in both complexity (thanks to no regularization) and robustness against complex noise (e.g., mixed types of noises).

AB  - High-fidelity face digitization solutions often combine multi-view stereo (MVS) techniques for 3D reconstruction and a non-rigid registration step to establish dense correspondence across identities and expressions. A common problem is the need for manual clean-up after the MVS step, as 3D scans are typically affected by noise and outliers and contain hairy surface regions that need to be cleaned up by artists. Furthermore, mesh registration tends to fail for extreme facial expressions. Most learning-based methods use an underlying 3D morphable model (3DMM) to ensure robustness, but this limits the output accuracy for extreme facial expressions. In addition, the global bottleneck of regression architectures cannot produce meshes that tightly fit the ground truth surfaces. We propose ToFu, Topological consistent Face from multi-view, a geometry inference framework that can produce topologically consistent meshes across facial identities and expressions using a volumetric representation instead of an explicit underlying 3DMM. Our novel progressive mesh generation network embeds the topological structure of the face in a feature volume, sampled from geometry-aware local features. A coarse-to-fine architecture facilitates dense and accurate facial mesh predictions in a consistent mesh topology. ToFu further captures displacement maps for pore-level geometric details and facilitates high-quality rendering in the form of albedo and specular reflectance maps. These high-quality assets are readily usable by production studios for avatar creation, animation and physically-based skin rendering. We demonstrate state-of-the-art geometric and correspondence accuracy, while only taking 0.385 seconds to compute a mesh with 10K vertices, which is three orders of magnitude faster than traditional techniques. The code and the model are available for research purposes at https://tianyeli.github.io/tofu.

AB  - Disturbance mainly caused by recoil force in-evitably makes washing drone seriously deviate from the desired position, thereby reducing the cleaning efficiency. It is neces-sary to develop an effective anti-disturbance control method. Although some progresses have been made, the position error thereof is still large, rendering existing methods inapplicable in washing drone. In this paper, we propose a learning-based anti-disturbance control (LADC) method to significantly reduce the position error by combining robust nonlinear control and partial differential equation network (PDENet). Taking data noise into account, we use differential spectral normalization in the training of the PDENet. A distinguishing feature of our method is to directly learn PDENet parameters from flight logs without installing extra sensors. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method outperforms classical PD method and extended state observer (ESO) based control method with 70 % and 50 % reduced position error, respectively, and can be further applied in variable scenarios.

AB  - Audio-visual information fusion enables a performance improvement in speech recognition performed in complex acoustic scenarios, e.g., noisy environments. It is required to explore an effective audio-visual fusion strategy for audiovisual alignment and modality reliability. Different from the previous end-to-end approaches where the audio-visual fusion is performed after encoding each modality, in this paper we propose to integrate an attentive fusion block into the encoding process. It is shown that the proposed audio-visual fusion method in the encoder module can enrich audio-visual representations, as the relevance between the two modalities is leveraged. In line with the transformer-based architecture, we implement the embedded fusion block using a multi-head attention based audiovisual fusion with one-way or two-way interactions. The proposed method can sufficiently combine the two streams and weaken the over-reliance on the audio modality. Experiments on the LRS3-TED dataset demonstrate that the proposed method can increase the recognition rate by 0.55%, 4.51% and 4.61% on average under the clean, seen and unseen noise conditions, respectively, compared to the state-of-the-art approach.

AB  - Large cities are increasingly investing in efficient mobility and sustainable transportation as an alternative to expensive and pollutant traditional vehicles. In parallel, people are also seeking cleaner and healthier options for short and last-mile distances. In order to cope with this trend, which has boosted the adoption of bikes in urban areas, a major concern of the governments has been to build bike paths and tracks that allow cyclists to move safely and through shorter distances. However, such initiatives may result in bicycles infrastructure built alongside traditional vehicular roads or on inadequate regions. Therefore, there should be a flexible way to assess the quality of bike paths and tracks, combining variables that indicate adverse conditions for the health and safety of cyclists, such as statistical risk of accidents, air and noise pollution, excessive sunlight exposure, dangerous UV radiation, among others. This article then proposes a new comprehensive quality metric that combines sensed environmental data and historical reported incidents related to bike paths and tracks, which may be employed for traditional physical signaling or to support computer-assisted solutions for cycling monitoring and alerting. Such new metric exploits fuzzy logic to model a group of variables to ultimately provide a unified safety and health quality level, referred as BikeWay. Doing so, we expect to allow dynamic and historical perceptions of how healthy and safe the bike paths and tracks are for cyclists in modern cities.

AB  - Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is the contemporary technology adopted for digital audio/video broadcasting as well as wireless local-area and metropolitan-area networks. Since the wireless multimedia services often have different quality-of-service requirements and their performance is sensitive to the channel conditions, the conventional fixed OFDM modulation scheme might not be a satisfactory solution nowadays. In this paper, we introduce a novel pilot-free adaptive modulation scheme, which is bandwidth-efficient and allows variable data rates, for the future robust OFDM systems. We design a number of modulation modes in a combination of different constellation sizes and different polynomial cancellation coding methods (PCC) to combat the crucial intercarrier interference problem. Instead of estimating the channel quality based on the overhead pilot symbols, we propose to directly estimate the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) without using any pilot. Besides, our scheme offers more modulation modes than some other existing adaptive modulation methods which are simply based on different constellation sizes. According to the Monte Carlo simulations, the empirical results show that our adaptive modulation scheme, in most channel conditions (SNR/spl ges/15 dB), not only can satisfy the predetermined bit error rate (BER) requirement (BER/spl les/10/sup -4/) but also can dynamically enhance the throughputs in the rather clean environments with high SNR values.

AB  - $\ell _{2,1}$-norm penalized compressive sensing (CS) is utilized to improve the performance of DOA estimation with small snapshots recently. However, the existing CS-based methods are not robust to the noise. In this article, we propose a CS-based DOA estimation using a novel weighted $\ell _{2,1}$-norm penalty. A spatial filter which can roughly “clean up” or eliminate the signals coming from the directions of the true sources is constructed. Thus, the space spectrum of the spatial filter can work as a weighting matrix to adjust the sparse penalty automatically. A new weighted $\ell _{2,1}$-norm penalty based on this spatial filter is then proposed for DOA estimation. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm.

AB  - Sign language (SL) is used by hearing impaired and deaf people. The WiFi-based sign language recognition (SLR) technology has attracted much attention due to its contactless nature and wide applications. Most previous SLR works are designed to recognize a single isolated sign word in data samples. However, such assumption is not realistic in practical applications, such as, in daily communication, deaf people usually express their mind through a phrase (a.k.a. a group of words) rather than an isolated word. Compared with the previous works, the sign words in a phrase have variety of length, sequential patterns, and combinations in realistic communications between deaf people. Therefore, it is challenging in exploiting the WiFi signals to accurately capture the unique patterns of SL in the previous natural setting. In this article, we propose Wi-Phrase, a multigesture context-awareness SLR system. Wi-Phrase exploits WiFi signals to translate SL to the English phrase. To achieve this, Wi-Phrase employs principal component analysis (PCA) projection to filter out the noise and convert cleaned WiFi signals to spectrogram. Then, we propose a novel Residual-MultiHead model that exploit residual learn structure to obtain local patterns of phrases and adopt multihead block to capture the global context information of phrase. To prove the advanced nature of our model, we design a WiFi-based SL phrase data set of 40 categories for experiments. Our comprehensive evaluation shows that Wi-Phrase achieves an accurate phrase recognition accuracy of 95.03%. In future, we envision Wi-Phrase could be widely used as the phrase command control system for deaf people in IoT devices.

AB  - Automatic lying posture tracking is an important factor in human health monitoring. The increasing popularity of the wrist-based trackers provides the means for unobtrusive, affordable, and long-term monitoring with minimized privacy concerns for the end-users and promising results in detecting the type of physical activity, step counting, and sleep quality assessment. However, there is limited research on development of accurate and efficient lying posture tracking models using wrist-based sensor. Our experiments demonstrate a major drop in the accuracy of the lying posture tracking using wrist-based accelerometer sensor due to the unpredictable noise from arbitrary wrist movements and rotations while sleeping. In this paper, we develop a deep transfer learning method that improves performance of lying posture tracking using noisy data from wrist sensor by transferring the knowledge from an initial setting which contains both clean and noisy data. The proposed solution develops an optimal mapping model from the noisy data to the clean data in the initial setting using LSTM sequence regression, and reconstruct clean synthesized data in another setting where no noisy sensor data is available. This increases the lying posture tracking F1-Score by 24.9% for ‘left-wrist’ and by 18.1% for ‘right-wrist’ sensors comparing to the case without mapping.

AB  - In recent years, uncertain data management applications have grown in importance because of the large number of hardware applications which measure data approximately. For example, sensors are typically expected to have considerable noise in their readings because of inaccuracies in data retrieval, transmission, and power failures. In many cases, the estimated error of the underlying data stream is available. This information is very useful for the mining process, since it can be used in order to improve the quality of the underlying results. In this paper we will propose a method for clustering uncertain data streams. We use a very general model of the uncertainty in which we assume that only a few statistical measures of the uncertainty are available. We will show that the use of even modest uncertainty information during the mining process is sufficient to greatly improve the quality of the underlying results. We show that our approach is more effective than a purely deterministic method such as the CluStream approach. We will test the approach on a variety of real and synthetic data sets and illustrate the advantages of the method in terms of effectiveness and efficiency.

AB  - Acoustic events of interest sometimes are inherently intermixed with strong background noise, like underwater sounds or mechanical fault signals. The noise usually creates a low-SNR scenario, making it more difficult to detect the events of interest. Suffering from lack of prior knowledge, it is a difficult job to extract “correct” features from noisy acoustic mixtures for the target events. This paper addresses the detection problem for acoustic events based on low-SNR training data. A novel learning algorithm is proposed to extract the target’s template from noisy training data. Based on a target-guided band-pass filter using wavelet packets, which has been proposed in our previous work for low-SNR event detection, the template of a specific event is represented in the context of the wavelet packet energy spectrum. Template learning is then formulated as an optimization problem maximizing the detection performance which is quantified as the output SNR of the filtered signal. It is further proved that the original complex optimization problem is equivalent to a linear program which is easy to solve. A relatively sufficient database was built to simulate the noise-polluted training signals and the low-SNR detection task. Results show that the learning method can work at −15 dB and above, and the trained templates exhibit excellent detection performance comparable to the templates extracted from clean samples.

AB  - Detecting the changes is the common issue in many application fields due to the non-stationary distribution of the applicative data, e.g., sensor network signals, web logs and grid-running logs. Toward Autonomic Grid Computing, adaptively detecting the changes in a grid system can help to alarm the anomalies, clean the noises, and report the new patterns. In this paper, we proposed an approach of self-adaptive change detection based on the Page-Hinkley statistic test. It handles the non-stationary distribution without the assumption of data distribution and the empirical setting of parameters. We validate the approach on the EGEE streaming jobs, and report its better performance on achieving higher accuracy comparing to the other change detection methods. Meanwhile this change detection process could help to discover the device fault which was not claimed in the system logs.

AB  - Due to the limitation of sensors and atmospheric conditions, hyperspectral images (HSI) are always contaminated by heavy noises, which significantly limits the subsequent applications. To mitigate the problem, this paper proposes a novel subspace spatial-spectral low rank learning method for hyper-spectral denoising. It is based on the assumption that spectra in HSI lie in a low-rank subspace and nonlocal spatial patches are self-similar. The spectral low-rank property is explored by decomposing the clean HSI into two sub-matrices of low rank and the spatial self similarity is exploited by weighed nuclear norm minimization in a nonlocal sense. The proposed restoration model is formulated into an iterative optimization model which can be effectively solved by a cyclic descent algorithm. Experimental results on both simulated and real HSI datasets show that the proposed method can significantly outperform the state-of-the-art methods in terms of quantitative assessment and visual quality.

AB  - This chapter presents the existing techniques for data acquisition and data preprocessing in general; while the adoption of selected artificial intelligence models for solving the problems in different industries, such as thin‐film‐transistor liquid‐crystal display, solar cell, semiconductor, automotive, aerospace, chemical, and bottle industries. The analog‐to‐digital converter connects to various sensors installed on the equipment side to convert analog sensing signals into digital signals via its analog input/output ports. The chapter presents various sensing techniques and the issues of sensor selection and installation. The goal of data preprocessing is to eliminate the noise imbedded in the signal and extract key‐feature related information. Data preprocessing consists of three steps: segmentation, cleaning, and feature extraction. The chapter demonstrates four practical examples using real‐world data to validate techniques of data acquisition and data preprocessing. These include: detrending of the thermal effect in strain gauge data, automated segmentation of signal data, tool state diagnosis, and tool diagnosis using loading data.

AB  - New cameras such as the Canon EOS 7D and Pointgrey Grasshopper have 14-bit sensors. We present a theoretical analysis and a practical approach that exploit these new cameras with high-resolution quantization for reliable HDR imaging from a moving camera. Specifically, we propose a unified probabilistic formulation that allows us to analytically compare two HDR imaging alternatives: (1) deblurring a single blurry but clean image and (2) denoising a sequence of sharp but noisy images. By analyzing the uncertainty in the estimation of the HDR image, we conclude that multi-image denoising offers a more reliable solution. Our theoretical analysis assumes translational motion and spatially-invariant blur. For practice, we propose an approach that combines optical flow and image denoising algorithms for HDR imaging, which enables capturing sharp HDR images using handheld cameras for complex scenes with large depth variation. Quantitative evaluation on both synthetic and real images is presented.

AB  - Passive Bistatic Radar employs a local communications transmitter as an illuminator. A template for matched-filtering is obtained by steering a beam at the transmission source. However this signal is subject to sensor noise and may also contain delayed attenuated copies of the transmitted signal. Demodulation and remodulation of the signal provides a clean template, however this also removes transmitter effects, resulting in a less than ideal mismatched filter. Estimation of the carrier drift allows transmitter effects to be re-introduced to the template signal and results in ambiguity surfaces of improved quality.

AB  - Summary form only given. Power electronics has had rapid development in the last decade which has resulted in wider real-life applications at present. Along with the above, power converters lay the foundations of our future life by providing us with alternative and long-term solutions for environmentally clean renewable energy resources. A variety of power converter topologies have been developed in the past, and many new topologies are realised every day. While these converters are required to operate under a wide range of system conditions, the majority of the existing control system designs are based on tuning control gains at nominal conditions. As such gains can be tuned for particular operational condition(s), any out-of-nominal operation may cause converter control system to collapse. Secondly, most of existing designs disregard coupling effects in the plant dynamics results of which could be unsatisfactory performance at the operational envelope. In addition, there are inherent perturbations in power converters that cannot be compensated by such tuned controllers. Parametric uncertainties due to electrical elements, transportation/computational delays (as complex-valued uncertainties), sufficiently large load variations, voltage source distortions, unmeasured external disturbances (like faults), and sensor noises are examples of dominant perturbations that could affect the operation of power converters. Advanced robust control system designs can aid development for power converters with improved output performance. Besides, they offer clear optimisation and design guidelines to reduce the cost and size of converters. The goal of this talk is to highlight the benefits and capabilities of robust multivariable feedback control systems design in challenging power electronics applications. Along with a brief review on the pragmatic robust control design, results of such advanced designs in a number of power electronics and power systems control applications will be illustrated in this plenary paper.

AB  - In this work we describe in detail the architecture, design, testing and operation of the Electrical Ground Support Equipment (EGSE) “Blue Box” used to test and validate the Sampling Caching System (SCS) of the Mars 2020 Perseverance rover. The Blue Box architecture is centered around COTS motor controllers and COTS input-output modules communicating over an EtherCAT bus. A custom, low-level safety subsystem ensures no harm can be done to the flight articles. The modular architecture of the EGSE reduces cost and complexity while expediting assembly time. The Blue Box drives the 19 actuators of the SCS which span the main robotic arm, the corer system, the internal sample handling arm, the sample tube sealing system and the gas dust removal tool; mimicking the Rover Motor Control Assembly (RMCA). Due to the limited availability of RMCA's, the EGSE enabled and performed the bulk of testing activities for SCS. The majority of the SCS actuators are composed of a 3-phase DC brushless motors, hall sensors for commutation, dual resolvers for output angular measurement, brakes, heaters and platinum thermistors. Additionally, the EGSE read 12 strain gauges forming part of a force torque sensor, and switches used for external positioning references. Over the 3-year span of the V&V campaign for the SCS, over 32 EGSE systems were built, tested and deployed to test venues at JPL and externally. The EGSE tested several families of the SCS subsystem, ranging from engineering units, life test units and two flight units. Test venues that this EGSE supported included lab benches, ultra-clean cleanrooms, ATLO facilities, and thermal vacuum chambers. Together with the test software systems, SSDEV and SSDEV-ECAT, the Blue Box EGSE enabled the team to efficiently test flight hardware and flight software together. We go over the safety features and fault management techniques employed to protect flight hardware. The effects of the long, 50-feet, EGSE harnesses on motor performance, EMI, electrical noise, and motor control performance are explained. Mitigations to these unwanted effects, including shielding strategy and inductance compensation, are summarized. We go over an excerpt of notable anomalies that this EGSE suffered through its operation, along with investigations and resolutions. Lessons learned, areas of improvement as part of future work, and recommendations for future implementations for similar EGSE's, are shared.

AB  - The vast majority of fuzzy logic systems and applications employ singleton fuzzification because of its simplicity and speed of computation which allows for real time operation. However, using singleton fuzzification assumes that the input measurements are clean signals with no noise or uncertainty associated with them. The vast majority real world applications have high values of noise and uncertainty associated with the sensor and input values. Higher order Fuzzy Logic Systems (FLSs) such as interval type-2 FLSs have been shown to be very well suited to dealing with the high levels of uncertainties present in the majority of real world applications. However, it seems a paradox to use type-2 FLS to handle the encountered uncertainties while assuming that the input values to the type-2 FLS are perfect inputs when considering singleton fuzzification. Hence, we propose a hybrid approach, which employs non-singleton type-2 FLS where the inputs will be modeled by type-2 fuzzy sets to handle the numerical uncertainties, while the antecedent and consequent type-2 fuzzy sets in the type-2 FLS will be used to handle the linguistic uncertainties. One of the main problems in non-singleton fuzzification is to determine the shape and the parameters of the input variables and things get complicated when employing type-2 fuzzy based input variables. In this paper, we will present a novel method which is data driven to generate interval type-2 fuzzy sets to model the input variables in non-singleton type-2 FLS. The paper will report on various experimental results employing the proposed method to generate type-2 based fuzzy input variables.

AB  - In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of uncooperatively and covertly detecting people moving behind walls using passive bistatic WiFi radar at standoff distances. A series of experiments was conducted which involved personnel targets moving inside a building within the coverage area of a WiFi access point. These targets were monitored from outside the building using a 2.4-GHz passive multistatic receiver, and the data were processed offline to yield range and Doppler information. The results presented show the first through-the-wall (TTW) detections of moving personnel using passive WiFi radar. The measured Doppler shifts agree with those predicted by bistatic theory. Further analysis of the data revealed that the system is limited by the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR), and not the signal-to-noise ratio. We have also shown that a new interference suppression technique based on the CLEAN algorithm can improve the SIR by approximately 19 dB. These encouraging initial findings demonstrate the potential for using passive WiFi radar as a low-cost TTW detection sensor with widespread applicability.

AB  - Advances in computer processing power and emerging algorithms are allowing new ways of envisioning human-computer interaction. Although the benefit of audio-visual fusion is expected for affect recognition from the psychological and engineering perspectives, most of existing approaches to automatic human affect analysis are unimodal: information processed by computer system is limited to either face images or the speech signals. This paper focuses on the development of a computing algorithm that uses both audio and visual sensors to detect and track a user's affective state to aid computer decision making. Using our multistream fused hidden Markov model (MFHMM), we analyzed coupled audio and visual streams to detect four cognitive states (interest, boredom, frustration and puzzlement) and seven prototypical emotions (neural, happiness, sadness, anger, disgust, fear and surprise). The MFHMM allows the building of an optimal connection among multiple streams according to the maximum entropy principle and the maximum mutual information criterion. Person-independent experimental results from 20 subjects in 660 sequences show that the MFHMM approach outperforms face-only HMM, pitch-only HMM, energy-only HMM, and independent HMM fusion, under clean and varying audio channel noise condition.

AB  - Opportunistic navigation with cellular signals is studied and demonstrated on a high altitude aircraft. An extensive campaign was conducted by the Autonomous Systems Perception, Intelligence, and Navigation (ASPIN) Laboratory in collaboration with the US Air Force (USAF) to sample ambient cellular signals of opportunity (SOPs) at different altitudes in different regions in Southern California, USA. The carrier-to-noise ratio is characterized as a function of altitude and horizontal distance. It was found that signals from cellular transmitters can be reliably acquired and tracked for navigation purposes by receivers mounted on high dynamics aircraft flying at altitudes as high as 23,000 ft above ground-level (AGL) and horizontal distances as far as 100 km. The multipath channel is also characterized as a function of altitude, showing clean channels with a dominant line-of-sight component for altitudes up to 23,000 ft. To further assess the potential of cellular SOPs for aircraft navigation, a 51-km trajectory traversed over a period of 9 minutes was estimated exclusively using cellular SOPs (i.e., with no GPS or other sensors, except for barometric altimeter measurements), resulting in a three-dimensional (3&#x2013;D) position 10.5 m position root mean-squared error (RMSE).

AB  - Typhoons have been one of the most destructive natural disasters in the world. The Philippines has visited by about 20 tropical cyclones per year and the Bicol region is regarded to be the most disaster-prone area in the country. On November 1, 2020, a locally known Typhoon Rolly had struck the Bicol region causing widespread damage in the area. The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) significantly can use to quantify the damages or loss by detecting the changes in power outages before and after the typhoon using the well- calibrated day/night band (DNB). Comparison of the Nighttime light images help to determine the recovery phase of the Bicol region by extracting the red pixel value of the images using Python. The data were obtained from the EOSDIS worldview from September 2020 to March 2021. These images were affected by unnecessary noises thus, it has to be cropped and cleaned to have accurate pixel value. The primary objective of this research is to explore the use of the VIIRS instrument with DNB sensor as the first-hand method in monitoring and collecting data on recovering communities from typhoon among the affected population and human settlements. The analysis shows that Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) is useful in detecting power outages and has potential use in the rapid assessment of typhoon disasters. Rapid and effective assessment of typhoon damages is useful supplementary data for Government disaster response and policymaking.

AB  - Security has consistently been a significant worry for mankind. Today we have video surveillance cameras in schools, hospitals and every other public place that help keep these spaces secure. This is also including places with vehicles such as parking spaces and garages, and it would be embedded with a security guard that would also help monitor and verify entrance of any incoming vehicle, as well as controlling the opening and closing of the gate. The project will aim to develop a smart car plate recognition device that can monitor and survey the area, as well as detect and analyze vehicle license plates. A sensor will detect the incoming vehicle, then a camera will take a screenshot of the front of the vehicle with the license plate. The license plate is scanned then checked whether it is registered to determine whether it is allowed or denied entry, and the device will troubleshoot by sending SMS to a fixed phone number regarding any issues. We will use a supervised Machine Learning Optical Character Recognition model known as Tesseract AI. This pre-trained, multi-language AI will detect and extract the numbers and letters on the license plate. Before this process starts, we will clean the image of any noise by performing changes to the original image, such as switching to grayscale and brightening, in-order to increase the accuracy of the OCR and minimize error. These extracted numbers and letters will then be checked within the database one entry after the other until it detects a match. This device will be a direct upgrade over the traditional system of simply including a CCTV camera and a guard as the device will operate independently to a point that no human input is required and will require no installation of on-site servers or setup of databases, thus saving manpower and reducing cost and complexity.

AB  - Referring to the first law of geography and its extension in time domain, this research makes improvements on the two-step method (TSM) presented to retrieve seismic microwave brightness temperature (MBT) anomaly, and a new method named spatio-temporally weighted TSM (STW-TSM) is developed. Temporally weighted background is calculated using nonseismic data according to respective time intervals with the shocking year, and applied to remove long-term trend so as to retrieve basic MBT residuals. Spatially weighted background is calculated referring to Euclidean geospatial distance away from the epicenter, and applied to eliminate local meteorological noise so as to retrieve cleaned MBT residuals. With May 2008 Wenchuan earthquake sequence being a case study, significant seismic MBT anomalies at H and V polarizations, 10 days before and after the May 12 Mw7.9 main shock, were retrieved using STW-TSM at 6.9, 10.7, 18.7, and 36.5 GHz, respectively. This study shows that the newly developed STW-TSM is much more qualified. More significant seismic MBT anomalies at H polarization was retrieved as compared to V polarization. More detailed and localized MBT anomalies was uncovered from high frequency bands at 18.7 and 36.5 GHz, while much remarkable anomalies (but less details) were obtained from low frequency bands at 6.9 and 10.7 GHz. This research is valuable for satellite MBT observation, seismic anomaly analysis, and earthquake precursor study.

AB  - Prognostics and health management (PHM) for electronic devices is intricate yet crucial in an era of electricity. The impending future of electric vehicles and clean energy requires more in-depth scrutiny and monitoring of their storage elements, lithium-ion batteries. State-of-health (SOH), as one of the most evident indicators for battery degradation quantifications, is a matter of vital importance that worths more attention. In this regard, this article proposes a novel SOH prognostics framework for lithium-ion batteries considering the limitations in the recorded measurements through the use of linear statistical k-nearest neighbors (LSKNN) data interpolation, maximal information entropy search (MIES), and collective sparse variational Gaussian process regression (CSVGPR). First, the incomplete charging measurements are processed by LSKNN to infer the missing data points and suppress the unanticipated noises in the extracted temporal features, which indicate the trend of degradation. Then, the MIES scheme is proposed to filter the features that are extraneous to the SOHs of the corresponding batteries and that greatly correlate to the other features in the feature set. Finally, the CSVGPR model, considering the uncertainties within each of the sparse variational Gaussian processes, is utilized to implement SOH prognosis. The proposed framework is verified by a subset of the repository from NASA. In the test, multiple prognostics comparisons of inner-battery tests, cross-battery tests, and tests with other statistical learning methods are presented. The experiment results lend support to the superiority and effectiveness of the work.
