AB  - In this paper, the design considerations and basic equations related to thick-film screen-printed sensing devices are included. The geometry of the device and the patterns of the functional sensing film, or of the electrodes are taken into account for the determination of the operational frequency, noise voltage, quality factor and other key parameters, related to the proper work of the resistive, capacitive and surface acoustic wave based sensors. The determination of some parasitic components and possible errors is also provided. The focus is put on the most widely spread coating patterns related to this technology – meander and comb-shaped. The technology flow chart of the screen-printing technology is given and the approaches for fine-tuning the resistance at the thick-film resistive sensors are discussed. Comparison of the typically used materials for substrates, resistive, conductive, and dielectric coatings is made. Criteria for the selection of the different pastes or inks for specific applications are mentioned.

AB  - Vehicles with ferrous material composition change the distribution of uniform earth magnetic field around them. The anisotropic magneto-resistive (AMR) sensor usually has magnetic field detection range within ±10 Oe, which is suitable to detect the earth magnetic field at 0.25~0.65 Oe as a low cost solution. The AMR sensor is able to sense the vehicle induced magnetic field change and can be utilized as vehicle detection sensor. This work uses two AMR sensor nodes to measure the vehicle velocity on the road. Signal processing is applied to remove noise and to get clean signal for precise speed calculation. The vehicle speed measured by AMR sensor is validated by a high speed camera at 250 fps. The AMR sensor at low cost and low power is a promising vehicle speed sensor for traffic flow and density management in the intelligent transport system.

AB  - Nowadays, wireless sensor networks have been widely used in many monitoring applications. Due to the low quality of sensors and random effects of the environments, however, it is well known that the collected sensor data are noisy. Therefore, it is very critical to clean the sensor data before using them to answer queries or conduct data analysis. Popular data cleaning approaches, such as the moving average, cannot meet the requirements of both energy efficiency and quick response time in many sensor related applications. In this paper, we propose a hybrid sensor data cleaning approach with confidence. Specifically, we propose a smart weighted moving average (WMA) algorithm that collects confidence data from sensors and computes the weighted moving average. The rationale behind the WMA algorithm is to draw more samples for a particular value that is of great importance to the moving average, and provide higher confidence weight for this value, such that this important value can be quickly reflected in the moving average. Based on our extensive simulation results, we demonstrate that, compared to the simple moving average (SMA), our WMA approach can effectively clean data and offer quick response time.

AB  - The recent advances in sensor technologies have made these small, tiny devices much cheaper and convenient to use in many different applications, for example, the weather and environmental monitoring fields, the hospital and factory operation sites, on the traffic road and moving vehicles and so on. Data loss and corruption is inevitable in wireless sensor networks due to the wireless interference, limited sensor power and outlier from malicious electronic devices and so on. Therefore, before processing sensor data in different wireless sensor network applications, certain data cleaning steps need to be performed to ensure the data quality, such as dealing with outliers, missing sensor readings, and noisy data. In this paper, we discuss the issues need to be considered in the data cleaning steps of this integrated data cleaning model for signal processing in wireless sensor networks. We also present an integrated model for data cleaning on signal processing systems in wireless sensor network to deal with different data cleaning problems.

AB  - This paper focuses on the problem of environmental noises in human-human communication and in automatic speech recognition. To deal with this problem, the use of alternative acoustic sensors -which are attached to the talker and receive the uttered speech through skin or bones- is investigated. In the current study, throat microphones and ear bone microphones are integrated with standard microphones using several fusion methods. The results obtained show that the recognition rates in noisy environments are drastically increased when these sensors are integrated with standard microphones. Moreover, the system does not show any recognition degradations in clean environments. In fact, recognition rates also increase slightly in clean environments. Using late fusion to integrate a throat microphone, an ear bone microphone, and a standard microphone, we achieved a 44% relative improvement in recognition rate in a noisy environment and a 24% relative improvement in recognition rate in a clean environment.

AB  - Drones are widely utilized in various industries. Unfortunately, when a drone acquires sound through a microphone, which is installed itself, drone flying and wind noises appear in recorded signals. Therefore, it is necessary to reduce such drone flying and wind noises for enhancing the quality of the recorded sound signals for UAV acoustic sensor networks. In this paper, we proposes the noise reduction method using a deep convolutional denoising autoencoder for eliminating drone flying and wind noises. The deep convolutional denoising autoencoder is widely utilized to extract the target sound source in monaural audio source separation. To do this task, a training dataset is constructed by mixing drone flying and wind noises in clean speech signal. Also, we train the neural network model, which is in form of fully convolutional neural networks. From the sound signals recorded in the real outdoor environment, it is shown that the trained model can reduce the drone flying and wind noises, and only separate the target speech.

AB  - A conventional electrical capacitance tomography (ECT) sensor consists of multiple rectangular electrodes in a single plane. To generate 3-D images, some researchers use an ECT sensor with multiplane rectangular electrodes and in-line arrangement of different electrode planes and measure the capacitance between the electrode pairs not only within the same plane but also between different planes. Because those electrode pairs in different planes are far away from each other, the measured capacitance signals between them are weak and, hence, are easily affected by noise, resulting in the obvious disturbance on the measured signals and, hence, low image quality. To address those problems, the 3-D ECT sensors with different arrangements and different shapes of electrodes are studied to investigate the effect of different arrangements and different shapes of electrodes on the measured capacitance signals and the image quality. Four 3-D ECT sensors are made with different arrangements or shapes of electrodes: rectangular electrodes are in line arrangement, whereas diamond, circular, and hexagon electrodes are staggered arrangement. The performance of the four 3-D ECT sensors is compared. The results show that 3-D ECT sensors with staggered electrodes can decrease the disturbance on the measured signals and improve the image quality of static models compared with that with conventional rectangular electrodes. Among the three 3-D ECT sensors with staggered electrodes, the 3-D ECT sensor with hexagonal electrodes has superior performance to the other two 3-D ECT sensors with diamond and circular electrodes. It was used to measure moving objects and a fluidized bed.

AB  - We present work on improving the performance of automated speech recognizers by using additional visual information: (lip-/speechreading); achieving error reduction of up to 50%. This paper focuses on different methods of combining the visual and acoustic data to improve the recognition performance. We show this on an extension of an existing state-of-the-art speech recognition system, a modular MS-TDNN. We have developed adaptive combination methods at several levels of the recognition network. Additional information such as estimated signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is used in some cases. The results of the different combination methods are shown for clean speech and data with artificial noise (white, music, motor). The new combination methods adapt automatically to varying noise conditions making hand-tuned parameters unnecessary.

AB  - We present the first ultra-miniature (<;1 mm2) capacitive accelerometers built in the epitaxial polysilicon encapsulation (`epi-seal') process. Lateral (X/Y-axis) and out-of-plane (Z-axis) accelerometers were fabricated using a variant of the epi-seal process that utilizes a separate electrode defined in the encapsulation layer. Sensitivities of up to 10.2 fF/g and 0.24 fF/g were achieved for lateral and out-of-plane accelerometers respectively. Resolution down to 0.47 mg/rt-Hz is realized, approaching the theoretical Brownian limit for a combined accelerometer and off-the-shelf capacitance-measuring chip (AD7746) system. This enables singlechip integration of accelerometers, gyroscopes, pressure sensors, thermometers, and clocks all in an established commercial manufacturing process.

AB  - Signal acquisition from the wrist using wearable device is usually corrupted by noise, sometimes up to a level where the noise completely dominates the signal. In this paper, we use the acquisition of photoplethysmography (PPG) signal as an example to demonstrate our proposed algorithm implemented on a sensor array. To increase the chances of acquiring clean PPG signal, we develop a uniform linear sensor array located above the radial artery. We also develop a wearable device to integrate our sensor array and our proposed algorithm. We propose centralized state sensing (CSS), a centralized algorithm suited to our sensor array, to increase the efficiency in multi-sensor estimation. To support our proposed algorithm, we use heart rate estimation as an example and compare it with the estimation of a single sensor and the statistical mean of the estimation of multiple sensors. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposal achieve a reduction in mean absolute error of 26.8%, compared to the estimation result obtained using the average of the estimation of all sensors. Operating on a 80 MHz processor, our algorithm introduces a 8 ms overhead, making it highly suitable for wearable devices.

AB  - Generating real-time fused combinations of VNIR, SWIR and LWIR imagery enhances situational awareness, task performance, and overall image quality. However, no quantitative means to link image quality metrics with task performance exist for fused imaging, the way it does for single modality imaging. We illustrate how fused image quality is affected by multiple dimensions, including scene illumination, reflectance contrast, thermal contrast, sensor resolution, noise-limited resolution, local adaptive gain & contrast enhancement, noise cleaning, and fusion methodology. Task performance has also been assessed in two field collection campaigns, and multiple human performance tests in the lab using field data. Though image fusion clearly improves subjective image quality, a means to predict task performance improvement is still lacking

The aim of this research is to automatically compile a summary report about the performed ADLs which can be easily interpreted by caregivers. In this work the classification performance of the WASN will be evaluated in both clean and noisy conditions. Moreover, the computational complexity of the WASN and solutions to reduce the required computational costs are examined as well. The obtained classification results indicate that the computational cost can be reduced by a factor of 2.43 without a significant loss in accuracy. In addition, the WASN yields a 1.4% to 4.8% increase in classification accuracy in noisy conditions compared to single microphone solutions.

The imager, fabricated in 0.18 mum CMOS technology, provides low- noise operation by employing both the active reset (AR) technique and the active column sensor (ACS) readout method. The emission filter was fabricated using PDMS and Sudan II Blue dye mixed, spin-coated and deposited in the class 1000 clean room. The designed filter is suitable for excitation at wavelengths below 340 nm and emission at 450nm and above. Filter properties, such as thickness, transmission and efficiency of utilization with the fabricated imager are discussed. Preliminary measurements of the system using microbeads are also presented.

AB  - Gradient field localization, such as chemical and heat source location, is a complex problem, yet few designs have been proposed. Examples are locating fires, thermal leaks in insulation, explosive vapors, illegal substances, and chemical leaks. In this paper, we propose one 4 sensor stationary array to localize the direction-of-arrival (DOA) of a temperature source and model the approach on our previous biologically-inspired array processing technique. Several variants of the algorithm are shown, and with each degree of sophistication, it significantly reduces the DOA variance caused by noisy measurement conditions. Next, a clean 4/8-sensor version of the array was constructed, and it is shown that sensor cooperation improves the adaptation in diffusive, turbulent, and noisy environments.

AB  - Source camera linking, i.e., establishing whether or not the images of interest are taken by the same camera without the camera and its digital fingerprint in the investigator's possession, is an important aspect of image forensics. Sensor pattern noises (SPNs), extracted from digital images as device fingerprints, have been proved as an effective way for digital device identification and have been used for device linking as well. However, as we demonstrate in this work, the limitation of the current method of extracting the sensor pattern noise is that the SPNs extracted from images can be severely contaminated by the details from scenes. This makes device linking a more challenging problem than source device identification because the absence of the camera prohibits the acquisition of a clean fingerprint of the camera. In this work we propose a novel approach for attenuating the influence of the details from the scenes on sensor pattern noises so as to improve the correct rate of device linking. The hypothesis underlying our SPN enhancement method is that the stronger a signal component in a SPN is, the less trustworthy the component should be and thus should be attenuated. This hypothesis suggests that an enhanced SPN can be obtained by assigning weighting factors inversely proportional to the magnitude of the SPN components.

AB  - Staircase waveforms of metal oxide sensor response modulated heater temperature were analysed and the alternative transient signal processing was proposed to improve the selectivity and sensitivity of gas sensor in order to identify various types of volatile organic compounds. Twenty-one steps of ramping voltage up and down were applied to the sensor heater and the step responses were investigated by wavelet transform for both the step levels and decay characteristics in each step. For the step decay signal analysis, Haar and the fourth order daubechies wavelets were used to decompose and analyze the signal into the seventh level resolution. The approximate coefficients at the seventh level can be used to represent the step level response. The unequal transient response during heating up and cooling down processes of each sensor for different vapours can be determined by the difference between approximate coefficient and its next step value. The detail coefficients of the level less than the fourth level were neglected to clean out unimportant detail and noise. The detail coefficients at the fourth level were employed to illustrate the unique decay feature at each step response. The wavelet coefficients containing major transient characteristic of each vapour can be selected and used as input parameters for identifying species of odour by principal component analysis without problem of voltage offset shifting.

AB  - Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), despite being energy-efficient when implemented on neuromorphic hardware and coupled with event-based Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVS), are vulnerable to security threats, such as adversarial attacks, i.e., small perturbations added to the input for inducing a misclassification. Toward this, we propose DVS-Attacks, a set of stealthy yet efficient adversarial attack methodologies targeted to perturb the event sequences that compose the input of the SNNs. First, we show that noise filters for DVS can be used as defense mechanisms against adversarial attacks. Afterwards, we implement several attacks and test them in the presence of two types of noise filters for DVS cameras. The experimental results show that the filters can only partially defend the SNNs against our proposed DVS-Attacks. Using the best settings for the noise filters, our proposed Mask Filter-Aware Dash Attack reduces the accuracy by more than 20% on the DVS-Gesture dataset and by more than 65% on the MNIST dataset, compared to the original clean frames. The source code of all the proposed DVS-Attacks and noise filters is released at https://github.com/albertomarchisio/DVS-Attacks.

AB  - A floating raft structure sensor using piezoelectric polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) film as sensitive material for grain loss detecting of combine harvester was presented in this paper. Double-layer vibration isolator was proposed to eliminate the vibration influence of combine harvester. Signal processing circuit which composed of a charge amplifier, band-pass filter, envelope detector, absolute value amplifier and square wave generator was constructed to detect the grain impact signal. According to the impact duration of grain on PVDF film, critical frequencies of band-pass filter were determined and the impact responses of filter under different impact durations were numerical simulated. Then, grain detecting experiments were carried out by assembling the sensor on the rear of vibrating cleaning sieve, the results showed that the grain impact can be identified effectively from vibrating noise and the sensor can output a standard square voltage signal while a grain impact is detected.

AB  - As the number of high-rise buildings is increasing, more methods of exterior-wall cleaning are being developed. There are a few models based on artificial intelligence that determine the type and level of contamination primarily by moving the cleaning area. In this study, we propose an system using YOLOv3 algorithm, color-detection, to install on façade cleaning robot and brightness-discrimination. There are three types of contaminant-detection parameters: size, color, and brightness, and these parameters are subjected to a robust optimization process to maintain a constant detection rate under different conditions. The three parameters are determined via Taguchi method with signal to noise ratio and noise factors. An environment for algorithm testing is established, and artificial contamination is implemented on the specimen. A field test with the detection algorithm shall be performed in the near future.

The proposed approach is based on the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and a vector of Hurst exponent coefficients. The scheme is investigated considering real acoustic noisy signals with different non-stationarity degree and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The results demonstrate that the EMD-based noise detector enables a better separation between the clean and noisy signals when compared to the competing methods. It also leads to an average SNR improvement of 4.4 dB for the resulting enhanced signals.

A distributed adaptive estimation algorithm for a fully-connected WSN is then proposed demonstrating that this MWF can be obtained by letting the nodes work on compressed (i.e. reduced-dimensional) sensor signals compared to the centralized approach. The algorithm can be used in applications such as speech enhancement in an acoustic sensor network, where (some of) the nodes nodes have prior knowledge on the location of the desired speech source and on their local microphone array geometry or have access to clean noise reference signals.

AB  - Floor cleaning robot has gained popularity in the European country. When people are busy with their work, the robot is to take over house cleaning task. Most of the service robot technologies become more and more matured so that applications far beyond fetch and carry tasks will be possible in near future. Most of the robot perform one task at the time. To be of any use, cleaning robots should be able to monitor the outcome of their work, or the need to remove dirt at the beginning for point-wise cleaning. This paper presents an approach towards the detection of various dirt on textured surfaces using a Camera image. The algorithm aims at removing the regular part of the image with spectral residual filtering leaving only the dirt and some noise and introduced a novel method to identify mud on the floor. With further post-processing, it is possible to localize many kinds of dirt in the image.

AB  - Accurate DOA estimation based on clustering the inter-sensor data ratios (ISDRs) of a single acoustic vector sensor (AVS), referred as AVS-ISDR, relies on reliable extraction of time-frequency points with high local signal-to-noise ratio (HLSNR-TFPs) and its performance degrades in noisy environments. This paper investigates deep neural networks (DNNs) trained with noisy-clean speech pairs under different SNR levels and noise types to improve the performance of AVS-ISDR in noise conditions. The DNNs is trained to learn characteristics reflecting the level of speech information at different TFPs, which helps to generate a reliable spectral mask for obtaining a noise-reduced spectral. Correspondingly, a robust DOA estimation algorithm named as AVS-DNN-ISDR has been developed. Experimental results verify the proposed DNN-based spectral mask improves the reliable HLSNR-TFPs extraction at different SNR levels. Results from simulations and real AVS recordings further validate AVS-DNN-ISDR achieving high DOA estimation accuracy even when the SNR is lower than 0dB.

AB  - In recent years, data from various auxiliary acoustic and nonacoustic sensors have been used for enhancing noisy speech. These include bone-conduction microphones, surface electromyographic sensors, ultrasonic imaging of facial movements, etc. The signal from such sensors is correlated with the speech signal to varying degrees, and unlike microphone data, is typically not affected by acoustic background noise, making its use attractive for speech enhancement. In this paper, we discuss the measurement of the utility of such data from an information-theoretic perspective, and quantify the information that is shared between clean speech and the auxiliary signal, which is not present in the observed noisy speech signal. The measure is applied to simultaneously recorded air-and bone-conducted speech data.

Fabrication technique based on SOI (silicon on insulator) wafer was developed for making ultrathin single-crystalline structures down to 20 nm thick. Mechanical quality factor (Q-factor) of the cantilever decreases with decreasing thickness due to the energy dissipation on the surface; however heating in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) cleans the surface at the atomic scale, resulting in dramatic increase of the Q-factor. All measurements were performed in an UHV chamber equipped with a laser Doppler vibrometer. Leaving the cleaned cantilever in UHV, small quantities of molecule are adsorbed on the cantilever and lower the Q-factor. These behaviors are measured on both 170 nm thick Si[100] and 50 nm thick Si[111] cantilevers. Using these ultra-thin resonators, mass change below a picogram and external force loaded on the cantilever are demonstrated.

AB  - Pipeline monitoring has been one of the issue discuss in global crisis due to the high non-revenue water reported in the global. In this paper, the usage of an erbium doped fibre laser based sensor to monitor pipeline condition, especially leakage condition by manipulating the nonlinear laser dynamics effect is reported. Vibration of the pipeline was used as an external loss modulation to trigger the chaotic condition of the fibre sensor to induce power changes on the optical sensor. The output of the optical sensor is found to be closely related to the vibration pattern of the pipeline. Hence, by catching the abnormal vibration signal of the pipeline, the health condition of the pipeline can be predicted. The vibration signal is measured and compared with an accelerometer in time and frequency domain respectively. There are three conditions tested, including defect free pipe, near leaking point and far leaking point measurement. The experiment shows the unique responses of the sensor and analysis of signal-to-noise ratio in frequency diagram was performed. From the results, the proposed sensor offer an alternative choice from conventional accelerometer which shows a cleaner result with simpler interpretation for classifying the pipeline condition.

AB  - Wearable sensors enable the simultaneous recording of several electrophysiological signals from the human body in a non-invasive and continuous manner. Textile sensors are garnering substantial interest in the wearable technology because they can be knitted directly into the daily-used objects like underwear, bra, dress, etc. However, accurate processing of signals recorded by textile sensors is extremely challenging due to the very low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Systematic classification of textile sensor noise (TSN) is necessary to: (i) identify different types of noise and their statistical characteristics, (ii) explore how each type of noise influences the electrophysiological signal, (iii) develop optimal textile-specific electronics that suppress TSN, and (iv) reproduce TSN and create large dataset of textile sensors to validate various machine learning and signal processing algorithms. In this paper, we develop a novel technique to classify textile sensor artifacts in ECG signals. By simultaneously recording signals from the waist (textile sensors) and chest (gel electrode), we extract TSN by removing the chest ECG signal from the recorded textile data. We classify TSN based on its morphological and statistical features in two main categories, namely, slow and fast. Linear prediction coding (LPC) is utilized to model each class of TSN by auto-regression coefficients and residues. The residual signal can be approximated by Gaussian distribution which enables reproducing slow and fast artifacts that not only preserve the similar morphological features but also fulfill the statistical properties of TSN. By reproducing TSN and adding them to clean ECG signals, we create a textile-like ECG signal which can be used to develop and validate different signal processing algorithms.

AB  - In the past two decades, wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and their applications have been the topic of many studies. Different multi-sensor nodes are used to collect, process and distribute data over wireless links to perform different tasks such as smart detection, target tracking, node localization, etc. In this article, the problem of distributed adaptive estimation of node-specific signals for signal enhancement or noise reduction is addressed. First the centralized rank R generalized eigenvalue decomposition (GEVD) based multichannel Wiener filter (MWF) with prior knowledge for node-specific signal estimation in a WSN is introduced, where (some of) the nodes have partial prior knowledge of the desired sources steering matrix. A distributed adaptive estimation algorithm for a fully-connected WSN is then proposed demonstrating that this MWF can be obtained by letting the nodes work on compressed (i.e. reduced-dimensional) sensor signals compared to the centralized algorithm. The distributed algorithm can be used in applications such as speech enhancement in a wireless acoustic sensor network (WASN), where (some of) the nodes have prior knowledge on the location of the desired speech sources and on their local microphone array geometry or have access to clean noise reference signals. Foundations for a proof of convergence using a Lagrangian framework, are given, since convergence is observed in batch-mode simulations. Finally, numerical simulation results are provided for a speech enhancement scenario.

AB  - With energy scarcity and environmental pollution becoming increasingly serious, the accurate estimation of fuel consumption of vehicles has been important in vehicle management and transportation planning toward a sustainable green transition. Fuel consumption is calculated by fuel-level data collected from high-precision fuel-level sensors. However, in the vehicle monitor platform, there are many types of error in the data collection and transmission processes, such as the noise, interference, and collision errors that are common in the high speed and dynamic vehicle environment. In this paper, an effective method for cleaning and repairing the fuel-level data is proposed, which adopts the threshold to acquire abnormal fuel data, the time quantum to identify abnormal data, and linear interpolation based algorithm to correct data errors. Specifically, a modified Gaussian mixture model (GMM) based on the synchronous iteration method is proposed to acquire the thresholds, which uses the particle swarm optimization algorithm and the steepest descent algorithm to optimize the parameters of GMM. The experiment results based on the fuel-level data of vehicles collected over one month prove that the modified GMM is superior to GMM-expectation maximization on fuel-level data, and the proposed method is effective for cleaning and repairing outliers of fuel-level data.

AB  - We developed a data evaluation technique that allows us to evaluate dynamically a kind of reliability of data from sensors by analytic redundancy among process variables. In this paper, we extend the data evaluation, combined with data reconciliation technique to handle the situation when both measurement error and gross error may exist. When gross error exists, data evaluation is used to filter out inadequate constraints used in data reconciliation. On the other hand, when measurement error exists, data reconciliation is used to filter out noise and hence provides data evaluation with clean relation among data. It is demonstrated by simulations that the combined method enhances diagnostic performance compared to that when both methods are applied independently.

AB  - This work examines the use of a Wireless Acoustic Sensor Network (WASN) for the classification of clinically relevant activities of daily living (ADL) of elderly people. The aim of this research is to automatically compile a summary report about the performed ADLs which can be easily interpreted by caregivers. In this work, the classification performance of the WASN will be evaluated in both clean and noisy conditions. Results indicate that the classification performance of the WASN is 75.3±4.3% on clean acoustic data selected from the node receiving with the highest SNR. By incorporating spatial information extracted by the WASN, the classification accuracy further increases to 78.6±1.4%. In addition, the classification performance of the WASN in noisy conditions is in absolute average 8.1% to 9.0% more accurate compared to highest obtained single microphone results.

AB  - This paper presents a study on alternative speech sensor for speech processing applications. Noise robustness is one of the major considerations in speech processing systems. In presence of noise, speech signal renders unintelligible naturally and thus degrades the performance of automatic speech recognition systems. Close-talk microphone perfums well for clean speech signals. The close-talk microphone based recognition performance fails under real non-stationary conditions and also degraded strongly by the background noise. One way of improving such a system performance is by the use of alternative sensors, which are attached to the speaker's skin and receive the uttered speech through throat or bones. There are two types of sensors namely alternative acoustic and non-acoustic sensors. First, alternative acoustic sensors are more isolated from environmental noise and pick up the speech signal in a robust manner. Second is to develop noisy robust speech recognition system using Multi-sensor approach. This approach combines the information from different sources of acoustic speech sensors. The thirdinvolves non-acoustic speech sensors, which are primarily used for speaker identification task and some speech recognition applications. Fourth, discusses the speech enhancement methods for the noisy speech signal. These approaches help to improve the speech recognition system in noisy conditions and lead to building a robust ASR system.

AB  - Large cities are paying a lot of attention to the dramatic challenges resulted from increasing air pollution and the global warming, struggling to find new promising solutions to face them. As a result, alternative transportation in urban areas has been sought, trying to reduce urban pollution while also addressing mobility issues in crowded cities. Actually, although bikes have been considered as a promising resource for more efficient and cleaner urban mobility, there are several concerns that must be considered when using bike paths already implemented in urban areas. In fact, some environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, noise pollution, ultraviolet radiation and light intensity can bring several problems to the health of cyclists who are constantly exposed to them, thus requiring constant and historical analysis of these conditions. In this context, this paper proposes an environmental monitoring system based on low-cost mobile sensors-based devices attached to bikes, which allow the identification of the most recommended areas for cycling in relation to possible damage to the health of cyclists. For that, the electronic components chosen for the construction of those devices must be highly accessible and affordable, supporting large-scale development. Additionally, the proposed approach is based on a hybrid communication model that does not require any urban communication infrastructure, easing its practical exploitation. The proposed approach seeks then to provide better support to governments when assessing the conditions of the currently installed bike paths and also when planning the implementation of new paths, potentially bringing important contributions to the management of modern cities.

AB  - Wearable electrocardiogram (ECG) sensors technology has great significance today since it can continuously monitor people's health conditions. In this work, we set out to design a high-quality amplifier circuit that can be used for wearable ECG sensors technology. This amplifier was constructed by a three-stage circuit, which included a human body model, input, and amplifier circuit, and connect the circuit. The proposed circuit used two operational transconductance amplifiers, which can lower power supply and power consumption. LTspice environment was utilized to simulate the circuit and analyze the result. The simulation presented that the common mode rejection ratio of this work was about 86.73dB. The input-referred noise was about $6.4 \mu\text{Vrms}$, and the noise was about $2.89 \mu\mathrm{W}$ for each operational transconductance amplifier. The result demonstrated that the amplifier was of good quality, having the potential to be adopted into wearable ECG sensors technology for its capability to extract and amplify clean electrocardiogram signals.

This facilitates the experts to provide guidance from the places they are currently available to where it is required immediately. Portable device is designed using CC2540 network processor supported by wireless sensors for recording ECG, EMG and EEG. The key advantages of this processor are low power requirement, built-in Bluetooth and cost effective. OMAP 3530 is an embedded processor used to design the portable terminal supported by USB based Bluetooth device and a display. This portable terminal is efficient, energy saving and is very useful for wireless monitoring applications. Noise cancellation of acquired signals is done before transmitting them to remote areas using morphological filtering. Clean signal that is obtained enable the medical experts to provide exact guidance. The filtered signals are stored in a database at local areas and then transmitted to remote areas through network support provided by Wi-Fi or 3G technology.

AB  - Usefulness of one-class support vector machine (SVM) is demonstrated for detection of outliers in surface acoustic wave (SAW) sensor array data for odor recognition. The one-class SVM for outlier detection is essentially a two-class pattern recognition formulation wherein outliers are considered to be the only target class, and the rest data points are grouped to make a normal class. The construction of decision function needs training with known class identities. In test phase, the algorithm picks up those data points as outlier which do not classify as normal. The SAW sensor array is an important platform for making electronic noses that fulfill varied needs of specific applications. The outliers in SAW electronic noses may occur due to electronic instabilities, fluidic fluctuations, electromagnetic interference, temperature fluctuation, or presence of non targeted chemicals. Therefore, it is important to clean up data for outliers for achieving high performance SAW odor recognition system. Even though one-class SVM has been used in other applications such as image processing and text recognition, here we analyze its suitability for sensor array based electronic nose data. A simulated SAW sensor array dataset comprised of 11 sensors and 6 vapor classes laden with varied levels of noise and outliers is considered. It is shown that the one-class SVM is quite efficient for detection of outliers in electronic nose data.

AB  - The emergence of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) to enhance manufacturing and industrial processes allows data analysts to address significant problems such as predictive maintenance. For the purpose of accurate data analysis, cleansing noisy sensor data is one of the most fundamental and necessary steps. Without first removing the noise, the anomaly detection techniques are likely to give a large number of false positives. However, using traditional outlier detection methods directly for such analysis are not appropriate as both noise and significant anomalies might exist in the sensor data. This article introduces the new challenges and proposes a novel solution to address the issue of removing noise while preserving anomalies in the IIoT Data. It proposes an approach that measures both the rate of change and deviation to compute the noise score. It employs a sliding window technique to define the analysis unit of the contrast measure which is used in conjunction with statistical techniques. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the other state-of-the-art noise detection methods, providing a clean data set that preserves the anomalies on which one can effectively apply anomaly detection techniques.

AB  - This paper presents the design of a compliant manipulator using a series elastic actuator (SEA) and a mechanism for precisely measuring the force acting on the contact part of the manipulator without using a force sensor. It is important to maintain a constant contact force between the compliant manipulator and the wall in order to guarantee cleaning performance, and the ball screw mechanism is used to adapt to changes in the distance and the angle. Position-based impedance control is used to maintain a constant contact force when the manipulator interacts with the wall of the building, and the results confirm that the system stability is guaranteed when using SEA, regardless of the variation in the actual stiffness of the manipulator. The results of extensive experimentation using the test bench demonstrate the force tracking performance against various types of wall changes using the stiff wet-type cleaning manipulator. The results indicate that the stiffness of SEA affects the force tracking performance and system stability under the condition of the manipulator and environment interaction, and that the system stability and control performance can be improved by applying a robust force measurement mechanism to noise.

AB  - This paper describes the development and implementation of a combined metal and magnetic sensor suite for the detection of meteorites from a mobile robot. The relative disposition of the sensors and the overall configuration of the sensor suite with respect to the rover are such that clean measurements are achieved and interference is minimized. We validated the combined electromagnetic sensors in laboratory and field tests on a variety of stony and iron meteorites. Experiments show that both sensing modalities (eddy current and magnetic) are necessary to achieve comprehensive readings from meteorites. The sensors have detected meteorites smaller than 2 cm in size. The sensor suite is configured to allow in-situ, autonomous calibration of the sensors and to mitigate noise from the electrical components of the robot that deploys them.

AB  - Emerging Internet of Things (IoT)-based environmental sensing projects provide large-scale sensing data from individual sensors with high reading frequencies. These readings are usually produced by commodity sensors with varied reliabilities, and inevitably contain noises and errors. Most existing data cleaning techniques focus on issues such as communication overhead reduction and energy preservation, and do not take advantage of the unaggregated data from individual sensors that IoT environmental sensing projects offer. In this paper, we propose an Expectation Maximization algorithm for finding reliable sensors in environmental sensing data that assumes the preservation of individual sensor readings and high reading frequencies. Our approach simultaneously finds the environmental feature model and the faulty state of the sensors. Our extensive experiments show that the proposed approach is significantly more effective than existing approaches. Particularly, in a case where reliable sensors and faulty sensors differ significantly in their readings, the maximum squared error for other approaches exceeds 200, but for our approach is only 1.23.

AB  - In this work an improved current sensor is proposed. The current sensor uses an advanced calibration algorithm and aims to achieve better than 1% accuracy. Hall effect based current sensors measure the magnetic field originating from the current. Hall element converts the field to a voltage using Hall effect. The nonlinearity of magnetic permeability in ferromagnetic core brings about nonlinearity during magnetic field generation and causes hysteresis. Thus, the accuracy of the Hall effect current sensor decreases. To prevent drop in accuracy, hysteresis characteristic of the sensor can be calibrated. The inputs are filtered to clean up noise. Creating a set of calibration polynomials, these functions can be used to improve sensor outputs. The algorithm can improve the sensor error performance from 1% in gain calibrated sensors to 0.3% for min RMS measurement error based calibration.

AB  - With the rapid growth in the use of various smart digital sensors, the Internet of Things (IoT) is a swiftly growing technology, which has contributed significantly to Industry 4.0 and the promotion of IoT-based smart factories, which gives rise to the new challenges of big data analytics and the implementation of machine learning techniques. This article proposes a practical framework that combines IoT techniques, a data lake, data analysis, and cloud computing for manufacturing equipment health-state monitoring and diagnostics in smart manufacturing. It addresses all the required aspects in the realization of such a system and allows the seamless interchange of data and functionality. Due to the specific characteristics of IoT sensor data (low quality, redundant multisources, partial labeling), we not only provide a promising framework but also give detailed insights and pay considerable attention to data quality issues. In the proposed framework, an ingestion procedure is designed to manage data collection, data security, data transformation and data storage issues. To improve the quality of IoT big data, a high-noise feature filter is proposed for automated preliminary sensor selection to suppress noisy features, followed by a noisy data cleaning module to provide good quality data for unbiased diagnosis modeling. The proposed framework can achieve seamless integration between IoT big data ingestion from the physical factory and machine learning-based data analytics in the virtual systems. It is built on top of the Apache Spark processing engine, being capable of working in both big data and real-time environments. One case study has been conducted based on a four-stage syngas compressor from real industries, which won the Best Industry Application of IoT at the BigInsights Data &#x0026; AI Innovation Awards. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of both the proposed IoT-architecture and techniques to address the data quality issues.

AB  - In this paper, a fully functional low light 128 X 128 contact image sensor for cell detection in biosensing applications is presented. The imager, fabricated in 0.18 mum CMOS technology, provides low-noise operation by employing both a modified version of the active reset (AR) technique and a modified version of the active column sensor (ACS) readout method. High-sensitivity, low noise performance of the presented sensor is well-suited for fluorescence imaging. For this purpose, an emission filter was fabricated and integrated with the sensor. The filter was fabricated using PDMS and Sudan II Blue dye mix, spin-coated and deposited in a class 1000 clean room. The designed filter is suitable for excitation at wavelengths below 340 nm and emission at 450 nm and above. The fabricated imager architecture and operation are described, noise analysis is presented and measurements from a test chip are shown. Experimental results using live neurons from the pond snail, Lymnaea stagnalis, and fluorescence polystyrene micro-beads prove the functionality of the fabricated system and indicate its biocompatiblity.

AB  - In this paper, we demonstrate a perceptual-based 3D skeleton motion data refinement method based on a bidirectional recurrent autoencoder, called BRA-P. Three main technical contributions are made by the proposed network. First, the proposed BRA-P can address noisy data with different noise types and amplitudes using one network, and this attribute makes the approach more suitable for raw motion data with heterogeneous mixed noise. Second, due to the usage of perceptual loss, which measures the difference in high-level features extracted by a pretrained perceptual autoencoder, BRA-P improves the perceptual similarity between refined motion data and clean motion data, especially for the case where the noisy data and target clean data have different topologies. Third, BRA-P further improves the bone-length consistency and smoothness of the refined motion using the perceptual autoencoder as a postprocessing network. Ablation experiments verify the effect of the three technical contributions of our approach. The results of the experiments on synthetic noise data and raw motion data captured by Kinect demonstrate that our method outperforms several state-of-the-art methods in the cleaning of mixed-noise data by one network.

AB  - The problem of noise reduction has attracted a considerable amount of research attention over the past several decades. Among the numerous techniques that were developed, the optimal Wiener filter can be considered as one of the most fundamental noise reduction approaches, which has been delineated in different forms and adopted in various applications. Although it is not a secret that the Wiener filter may cause some detrimental effects to the speech signal (appreciable or even significant degradation in quality or intelligibility), few efforts have been reported to show the inherent relationship between noise reduction and speech distortion. By defining a speech-distortion index to measure the degree to which the speech signal is deformed and two noise-reduction factors to quantify the amount of noise being attenuated, this paper studies the quantitative performance behavior of the Wiener filter in the context of noise reduction. We show that in the single-channel case the a posteriori signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) (defined after the Wiener filter) is greater than or equal to the a priori SNR (defined before the Wiener filter), indicating that the Wiener filter is always able to achieve noise reduction. However, the amount of noise reduction is in general proportional to the amount of speech degradation. This may seem discouraging as we always expect an algorithm to have maximal noise reduction without much speech distortion. Fortunately, we show that speech distortion can be better managed in three different ways. If we have some a priori knowledge (such as the linear prediction coefficients) of the clean speech signal, this a priori knowledge can be exploited to achieve noise reduction while maintaining a low level of speech distortion. When no a priori knowledge is available, we can still achieve a better control of noise reduction and speech distortion by properly manipulating the Wiener filter, resulting in a suboptimal Wiener filter. In case that we have multiple microphone sensors, the multiple observations of the speech signal can be used to reduce noise with less or even no speech distortion.

AB  - The pulse oximeters are used to measure the heart rate and arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2). The photoplethysmographic (PPG) signals from pulse oximeters are highly influenced by the noise generated due to movement. The signal is also affected by the ambience light signal. It is essential to obtain a clean signal for the measurement of arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2). In this paper, an Adaptive Noise Cancelling (ANC) technique is being used to remove noise from the signal. A tri-axial based accelerometer data is also taken during the data acquisition time. Normalized Least Mean Square (NLMS) based adaptive filter algorithm is adopted. Tri-axis accelerometer data gives the directional data along the entire three axes. They are summed up and they are fed into the adaptive filter as reference noise signal. In the filter, the coefficients are updated based on the error signal and they are updated till the error becomes minimum. From the obtained clean signal oxygen saturation is calculated by finding the normalized ratio of ratios. Accelerometer based adaptive noise cancellation is found to reduce the errors in arterial oxygen saturation. The mean result for the mentioned algorithm is around 0.2409. The result is also found to be in correlation with the reference pulse oximeter.

AB  - In this paper, we propose a Bayesian minimum mean squared error approach for the joint estimation of the short-term predictor parameters of speech and noise, from the noisy observation. We use trained codebooks of speech and noise linear predictive coefficients to model the a priori information required by the Bayesian scheme. In contrast to current Bayesian estimation approaches that consider the excitation variances as part of the a priori information, in the proposed method they are computed online for each short-time segment, based on the observation at hand. Consequently, the method performs well in nonstationary noise conditions. The resulting estimates of the speech and noise spectra can be used in a Wiener filter or any state-of-the-art speech enhancement system. We develop both memoryless (using information from the current frame alone) and memory-based (using information from the current and previous frames) estimators. Estimation of functions of the short-term predictor parameters is also addressed, in particular one that leads to the minimum mean squared error estimate of the clean speech signal. Experiments indicate that the scheme proposed in this paper performs significantly better than competing methods

AB  - Respiratory sounds contain crucial information concerning the physiologies and pathologies of pulmonary system. Computerized respiratory sound analysis can provide an objective evaluation of the respiratory function. Usually, the real environments of respiratory sound measurement are noisy. The less clarity of respiratory sounds could cause the utilization of computerized respiratory sound analysis technology in normal circumstances unfeasible. The objective of this paper was to evaluate the performance of least mean square (LMS) adaptive filter, the dual sensor spectral subtraction algorithm (DSSS), and independent component analysis (ICA) in eliminating the environmental noises from respiratory sounds. The performance analysis of these three methods was quantified by relative error of power spectral density between the clean lung sound and the denoised lung sound. Our experimental results indicate that the DSSS algorithm has a relatively better performance in removing the environmental noises at low SNR levels (5 dB and 10dB).

AB  - Dynamic defects on floor of large Aboveground Storage Tanks (AST) may lead to serious tank accidents and loss of properties. Acoustic emission (AE) has been used in storage tank floor inspection to rank maintenance priority in recent years before using other non-destructive methods, such as magnetic flux leakage, eddy current and ultrasonic. There are both economical and environmental benefits by not emptying and cleaning large storage tanks. This paper mainly covers principle of corrosion condition inspection for storage tank floor using AE method and investigation on AE sensors used in the test. Frequency, number, and installation requirements including height, space, and coupling agent are investigated in detail. Nielsen-Hsu pencil break calibration process for AE inspection channel is introduced. In the end, an AE inspection was carried out on a 20000m3 AST containing crude oil. Optimized BP Neural network is used in pattern recognition to remove electro-magnetic noise and mechanical fiction noise.

AB  - With the increasing clock speed and complexity of SoCs, measuring clock jitter becomes challenging. To effectively manage the tight jitter performance required by an SoC, the clock quality should be directly evaluated at every point where the clock is used in the SoC. In previous work [1-3], on-chip clock measurements were carried out, but these circuits are difficult to integrate into varied systems due to their special requirements of low-noise analog circuitry, a clean reference clock and additional calibration. We propose a fully synthesizable period jitter sensor (PJS), requiring no analog circuit, reference or calibration by improving upon a stochastic time-to-digital converter (TDC) [4]. The inverter delay chain of the stochastic TDC in [4] has a weakness: it may lose delayed signals due to its lengthy delay chain. It is replaced with a short-pulse delay chain, which does not lose delayed signals under any process, voltage and temperature (PVT) conditions. In addition, the proposed PJS is specified in RTL code and is fully synthesizable. It achieves 0.5pspp resolution for real-time period jitter measurements when its input clock frequency is 1GHz.

AB  - Assessing the quality of sensor data in environmental monitoring applications is important, as erroneous readings produced by malfunctioning sensors, calibration drift, and problematic climatic conditions such as icing or dust, are common. Traditional data quality checking and correction is a painstaking manual process, so the development of automatic systems for this task is highly desirable. This study investigates machine learning methods to identify and clean incorrect data from a real-world environmental sensor network, the Jornada Experimental Range, located in Southern New Mexico. We analyze several learning algorithms and data replacement schemes and conclude that learning algorithms are an effective way of cleansing this type of datasets.

AB  - Water quality monitoring is a critical part of environmental management and protection. The detection of contamination and impurity levels in water is of importance for the protection of public health. In this paper, we present a novel method for detection of impurities in water based on measuring the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the surface acoustic wave (SAW) device. An aluminum nitride (AIN) based SAW device is fabricated for residues detection. NaCl and SiO2 are regarded as water-soluble and water-insoluble impurities in water respectively. The experimental results show that the SAW propagation surfaces are cleaner after evaporation of different kinds of water samples, which then result in higher SNRs. Nevertheless, for different mass concentrations of NaCl and SiO2 droplets, the SNRs of the SAW device are lower due to more residues left on the wave propagation path after evaporation.

AB  - A noise-robust classification method is proposed to discriminate the moving vehicle and walking human via the time-frequency feature extracted from the micro-Doppler signature of low resolution radar. Since the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) directly relates to the distance between the target and radar for a given noise power and radar power, the denoising preprocessing is usually required to increase the classification distance between the target and radar in the real application. In this paper, we extend the real-valued probabilistic principal component analysis model to the complex-value domain, and develop the complex probabilistic principal component analysis (CPPCA) model for the complex-valued echoes from the ground moving targets. Then, the denoising preprocessing is accomplished based on signal reconstruction with CPPCA model, where we utilize the Bayesian inference criterion (BIC) to adaptively select the principal components. Compared with the existing CLEAN-based noise reduction method, the CPPCA-BIC-based method can work without SNR prior information. After denoising, a 3-D time-frequency feature vector is extracted from the denoised micro-Doppler signatures of the two kinds of ground targets, and the classification is performed via support vector machine classifier. In the experiments based on the measured data, the proposed classification scheme shows good classification and denoising performances under the relatively low SNR condition. The proposed method can also be applied to other classification problems based on micro-Doppler effect.

AB  - We present a method to combine the standard and throat microphone signals for robust speech recognition in noisy environments. Our approach is to use the probabilistic optimum filter (POF) mapping algorithm to estimate the standard microphone clean-speech feature vectors, used by standard speech recognizers, from both microphones' noisy-speech feature vectors. A small untranscribed "stereo" database (noisy and clean simultaneous recordings) is required to train the POF mappings. In continuous-speech recognition experiments using SRI International's DECIPHER recognition system, both using artificially added noise and using recorded noisy speech, the combined-microphone approach significantly outperforms the single-microphone approach.

AB  - In a previous work, a novel technique for angle of arrival (AOA) measurement was proposed. This technique consists of sweeping the angular domain with one antenna, step by step, such that at each measurement step the received signal voltage at the rotating antenna (sensor) is measured. The signal voltage vector is the convolution between the antenna electric field pattern and the AOAs (magnitude and phase) of the incident wave. In this letter, a denoising CLEAN algorithm is modified and applied to this technique in order to eliminate spurious peaks and accurately find the AOAs of incoming waves. A set of measurements is made to evaluate the proposed algorithm. The results show the effectiveness of the denoising algorithm in reducing the noise level; a high angular precision in measured AOAs is noticed.

AB  - Convolutional neural networks have been the focus of research aiming to solve image denoising problems, but their performance remains unsatisfactory for most applications. These networks are trained with synthetic noise distributions that do not accurately reflect the noise captured by image sensors. Some datasets of clean-noisy image pairs have been introduced but they are usually meant for benchmarking or specific applications. We introduce a dataset [NIND] of DSLR-like images with varying levels of ISO noise which is large enough to train models for blind denoising over a wide range of noise. We demonstrate a denoising model trained with the NIND and show that it significantly outperforms BM3D on ISO noise from unseen images, even when generalizing to images from a different type of camera. The Natural Image Noise Dataset is published on Wikimedia Commons such that it remains open for curation and contributions. We expect that this dataset will prove useful for future image denoising applications.

AB  - This paper proposes a reduced-rank minimum description length (MDL) method to enumerate the incident waves impinging on a uniform linear array (ULA). First, a new observation data and a reference signal are formed from sensor data by means of the shift-invariance property of the ULA. A cross-correlation between them is calculated, which is able to capture signal information and efficiently suppress additive noise. Second, the normalized cross-correlation is used as initial information for a recursion procedure to quickly partition the observation data into two orthogonal components in a signal subspace and a reduced-rank noise subspace. The components in the noise subspace are employed to calculate the total code length that is required to encode the observation data. Finally, the model with the shortest code length, namely the minimum description length, is chosen as the best model. Unlike the traditional MDL methods, this method partitions the observation data into the cleaner signal and noise subspace components by means of the recursion procedure, avoiding the estimation of a covariance matrix and its eigendecomposition. Thus, the method has the advantage of computational simplicity. Its performance is demonstrated via numerical results.

AB  - Acoustic cavitation plays a key role in several fields including therapeutic medicine and cleaning. Meanwhile, acoustic cavitation is a hazardous phenomenon due to the damage to targets irradiated by ultrasound such as normal cells in the human body. Therefore, it is important to control cavitation. An accurate technique for measuring the amount of generated cavitation with the aim of its control is required. Therefore, we have been studying a novel accurate cavitation measurement technique that uses the broadband integrated voltage (BIV) calculated from the broadband noise measured by a hollow cylindrical cavitation sensor. In this study, the distribution of BIV in the direction of ultrasound propagation and parallel to the surface of the water in a water vessel was measured using a high resolution cavitation sensor that has improved spatial resolution. The distribution of BIV values measured using the cavitation sensor was compared with the distribution of sonochemiluminescence (SCL) emissions observed from the side of the vessel. In the results, high values of BIV in the direction of ultrasound propagation measured by the cavitation sensor exhibited an interval of approximately 5 mm. This interval corresponds to the half wavelength period of the operating frequency of 150 kHz. The high values of BIV agreed well with the observed distribution of SCL emissions. This indicates that the cavitation sensor has the potential to accurately measure the nodes and antinodes of a standing wave acoustic field. The distribution of BIV values in the direction parallel to the surface of the water also agreed well with SCL. The results show that BIV measured by the cavitation sensor has the potential to become an accurate tool for measuring the spatial distribution of acoustic cavitation generation.

AB  - In this paper, a new approach to the problem of impulsive noise reduction in image is presented. First, an image neighborhood hypergraph representation using a similarity measure is computed. Next, a detection procedure based on hypergraph properties is used to classify hyperedges either as noisy, or clean data. Then we apply a nonlinear filter to noisy detected pixels. The results show that the proposed method outperforms most of the basic algorithms for the reduction of impulsive noise.

AB  - This paper presents an analyzing and modeling scheme that can dig into the ship sensor data to generate models for ship motion prediction. As the raw sensor data contains information that is noisy and discontinuous, three data cleaning methods used for noise reduction, data continuing and resampling are developed. According to specific ship applications, various ship motion constraints are designed to filter and establish meaningful data sets which will be used in the modeling step. Correlation analysis within the data sets is performed to figure out how significant the sensor data contributes to the predictive target. An flexible neural network based modeling mechanism is implemented, in which the user can design the model based on the correlation analysis. By training and testing the neural network using the generated data sets, the ship motion predictive model is obtained. Through a case study of fine maneuvering, the scheme is verified efficient in analyzing and modeling sensor data for ship motion prediction.

AB  - Heart rate (HR) monitoring using photoplethysmographic (PPG) signals recorded from wearers' wrist greatly facilitates design of wearable devices and maximizes user experience. However, placing PPG sensors in wrist causes much stronger and complicated motion artifacts (MA) due to loose interface between sensors and skin. Therefore, developing robust HR estimation algorithms for wrist-type PPG signals has significant commercial values. In this paper, we propose a robust HR estimation algorithm for wrist-type PPG signals using multiple reference adaptive noise cancellation (ANC) technique-termed here as “MURAD.” The main challenge of using ANC for MA reduction is to devise a qualified reference noise signal (RNS) to the adaptive filter. We propose a novel solution by using four RNSs, namely, the three-axis accelerometer data and the difference signal between the two PPG signals. For each RNS, we get a different version of the cleaned PPG signal. Then, a set of probable HR values is estimated using all of the cleaned PPG signals, and then, the value that is closest to the estimated HR of the previous time window is chosen to be the HR estimate of the current window. Then, some peak verification techniques are employed to ensure accurate HR estimations. The proposed technique gives lower average absolute error compared to state-of-the art methods. So, MURAD method provides a promising solution to the challenge of HR monitoring using PPG in wearable devices during severe MA conditions.

AB  - Short-term traffic flow prediction plays a key role of Intelligent Transportation System (ITS), which supports traffic planning, traffic management and control, roadway safety evaluation, energy consumption estimation, etc. The widely deployed traffic sensors provide us numerous and continuous traffic flow data, which may contain outlier samples due to expected sensor failures. The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the use of various smoothing models for cleaning anomaly in traffic flow data, which were further processed to predict short term traffic flow evolution with artificial neural network. The wavelet filter, moving average model, and Butterworth filter were carefully tested to smooth the collected loop detector data. Then, the artificial neural network was introduced to predict traffic flow at different time spans, which were quantitatively analyzed with commonly-used evaluation metrics. The findings of the study provide us efficient and accurate denoising approaches for short term traffic flow prediction.

AB  - In today’s world, Global positioning system (GPS)-based navigation is inexpensive for providing position, velocity, and time (PVT) information. GPS receivers are widely used on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and these targets are vulnerable to deliberate interference such as spoofing. In this paper, GPS spoofing detection and mitigation for UAVs are proposed using distributed radar ground stations equipped with a local tracker. In the proposed approach, UAVs and local trackers are linked to the fusion node. The UAVs estimate their position and covariance using the extended Kalman filter framework and send it to a fusion node as primary data. Simultaneously, the time-varying kinematics of the UAVs are estimated using the extended Kalman filter and global nearest neighbor association tracker frameworks, and this data is transmitted to the central fusion node as secondary data. A track-to-track association is proposed to detect spoofing attacks using available primary and secondary data. After detecting the spoofing attack, the secondary data is subjected to a correlation-free fusion. We propose using this fused state as a control input to the UAVs to mitigate the spoofing attack. The spoofing scenario results show that using the predicted fusion state provides the same accuracy as a GPS receiver in a clean environment. Furthermore, because the innovation is calculated using the predicted fused state, there is no effect on the number of satellite signals on PRMSE. Additionally, in terms of PRMSE, radars with low measurement noise outperform radars with high measurement noise. The proposed algorithm is best suited for use in drone swarm applications.

AB  - We consider the problem of detecting the presence of an improper complex-valued signal, common among two or more sensors (channels), in the presence of spatially independent, colored improper noise and additive outliers. A source of improper noise is in-phase/quadrature-phase imbalance during down-conversion of bandpass noise to baseband at the receiver. For clean data (i.e., known to be outlier free), a nonparametric binary hypothesis testing formulation in frequency-domain, utilizing the discrete Fourier transform of an augmented measurement sequence, has been proposed in the literature, and it results in a generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT). In this paper we robustify this approach against additive outliers in the data, using a data-cleaning approach. Using some existing robust estimators of multivariate scatter, we first detect the outliers, and subsequently remove and replace them using vector median filtering to yield cleaned data. The existing GLRT is then applied to the cleaned data. The approach is illustrated via simulations. The considered problem has applications in diverse areas including spectrum sensing for cognitive radio.

AB  - Accurate and sufficient design of AMS signal paths is always being a challenge for system designers requiring high simulation performance of the analog model which also incorporates circuit level non-idealities. The new SystemC AMS extensions offer high simulation performance as well as capabilities of incorporating circuit level non-ideal effects. In this paper we modelled a low Over Sampling Ratio (OSR), second order Sigma Delta (ΣΔ) Analog to Digital Converter (ADC) which incorporates non-ideal effects like sampling jitter, kBT/CS noise, switch non-linearities, band-gap noise and operational amplifier non-idealities (such as finite gain, finite bandwidth, gain nonlinearity, slew rate, leakage and saturation effect). The ADC shows a performance bottle neck of 16 bits. State-of-Art signal conditioning techniques use adaptive correction methods inside the analog part or inside the DSP part of the ADC making it more complicated to realize. In our design we have implemented the adaptive filtration within the micro-controller to correct the noise ground as well as large signal non-linear effects to produce an output which is 20-bits clean, proving sufficiency of low order and low OSR of a ΣΔ ADC for 20 bit resolution as well as a simplified adaptive filtration scheme alleviating the need of adaptive blocks within the ADC.

AB  - Deep neural networks (DNNs) have shown phenomenal success in many real-world applications. However, a concerning weakness of DNNs is their vulnerability to adversarial attacks. Although there exist some methods to detect adversarial attacks, they often suffer from high computational cost and constraints on certain types of attacks, and ignore external features that could aid during attack detection. In this article, we propose fast confidence detection method (FCDM), an innovative method for fast confidence detection of adversarial attacks based on measuring the integrity of sensor pattern noise fingerprinting embedded in input examples. We note that the existing adversarial detectors are often designed as a binary classifier to differentiate clean or adversarial examples. However, the detection of adversarial examples can be much more complicated than such a scenario. Our key insight is that the confidence level of detecting an input sample as an adversarial example is a more useful info for the system to properly take an action to resist potential attacks. The experimental results show that FCDM is capable to give a confidence distribution model of the most popular adversarial attacks. And, using the confidence distribution model, FCDM can quickly determine the confidence level of the input sample. Based on different properties of the confidence distribution models associated with these adversarial attacks, FCDM can provide early attack warning including even the possible attack types of the adversarial attack examples. FCDM also has the following advantages: 1) it is effective for both a white-box attack and black-box attack; 2) it do not depend on the class of adversarial attacks and can be used as both known attack defense and unknown attack defense; and 3) it does not need to know the details of the DNN model and does not affect the functionality of the DNN. Since fast confidence detection method (FCDM) is a computationally heavy task, we propose an FPGA-based accelerator based on a series of optimization techniques, such as the quantization, data reuse and operation replacement, etc. We implement our method on an FPGA platform and achieve a system clock frequency of 279 MHz with a power consumption of the only 0.7626 W. Moreover, in the real system performance test, we obtain a high efficiency of 29.740 IPS/W and a low latency of just 44.1 ms with very marginal accuracy loss.

AB  - Graphical user interface is addressed for outlier detection in sensor measurement. One of the essential steps toward sensor measurement analysis and decision making is anomaly detection. Specifically, measurement noise may encounter abnormal readings, which affect the model algorithm and hence misleading decisions; hence, data must be explored, cleaned, and corrected before being considered for statistical analysis. In this paper, we propose an interactive, easy to navigate, and friendly user interface to extract and explore the sensor's abnormal measurement records. Extraction, visualization, and detection are the three main tasks of such an interface, particularly providing the user with a variety of predefined detection techniques as the first step toward data analysis. The interface is operated via Matlab, and the effectiveness of such a tool is demonstrated by the mean of real-time measurements extraction where different outlier detection is considered.

AB  - Autonomous quadrocopter recently has shown a significant usages and potentials to be used widely in the commercial market. This caused the aircraft to become a well-liked subject among the researchers and research organizations. With good controllability and stability on its motions will make the usability of the quadrocopter to perform a task reliably. For this to happen, clean signals from accelerometer and gyroscope sensors appreciably play an essential role. However, the sensor's signals are routinely encounter problems with noise and drift. Hence, a filter is required to correct this imperfectness. In this paper, a simplified algorithm for Kalman's filter appropriates to be used by a low-cost microcontroller is presented. The research mainly focuses on filtering noisy outputs from the accelerometer so that the output is necessarily clean to be used for real-time quadrocopter pitch and roll angles estimation. Experimental results on assessment of the algorithm by varying the process and measurement noises are provided. The results reveal with correct tuning on the noise parameters; the filter algorithm is satisfying to give stable angles values with fine accuracy.

AB  - The purpose of this study is trying to apply VM [1][2] for measuring machining precision of machine tools. As shown in the left portion of Fig. 1, the AVM server [3] needs process data, which contain sensor data and machining parameters, as inputs for predicting machining accuracies. However, most machine tools do not possess sensors for providing raw process data such as vibration, current, etc. Furthermore, machining operations usually possess severe vibrations and loud noises. It makes the raw data collected from sensors attached to machine tools with low signal-to-noise (S/N) ratios, thereby affecting the prediction accuracy of VM. Even though the AVM has been an effective way to conduct workpiece measurements in high-tech industries [1], there exist challenges when applying the AVM to machining industry. Besides embedding essential sensors on the machine tool effectively, the challenges are 1) Segmentation: to accurately segment essential part of the raw process data from the original NC file, 2) Data Cleaning: to effectively handle raw process/sensor data with low S/N ratios, and 3) Feature Extraction: to properly extract significant features from the segmented raw process data. This work proposes a novel GED-plus-AVM (GAVM) system as depicted in Fig.1 to resolve all the challenges mentioned above. These challenges are judiciously addressed and successfully resolved in this paper.

AB  - This article aims at determining the anomalies created by buried magnetic materials on the horizontal component of earth's magnetic field through the KMZ51 anisotropic magnetoresistive sensor (AMR) series and determining the upper surface image of the material through the sensor series located in different positions per soil by processing the sensor data obtained due to anomaly at different heights from the soil surface using a feedforward artificial neural network (ANN) trained with the Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) backpropagation algorithm. In our study, in this direction, first, a mechanical scanning system ensuring the 3-D movement of the sensors, a data capture module to process the data transmitted from the KMZ51 AMR sensors and to transmit to the computer, and a magnetic measurement system composed of a computer software package to evaluate and record the data transmitted to the computer were established. Afterward, the magnetic materials with known magnetic, chemical, and geometrical properties were buried in soil containing 28.5% magnetic particles and 4.1% natural moisture with the help of the measurement system and the voltage changes in AMR sensors resulting from the anomaly were transmitted into the computer through the 2-D movement of the platform. This process was repeated for five different heights. The voltage values obtained were converted into a data matrix; then, the undesired noises in data resulting from the magnetic character of soil were cleared by filtering through the median and the base. Such cleaned data were converted into black and white images with a threshold value calculation method for conversion into black and white in grayscale histograms developed by “Otsu”; and the upper surface image of the buried material was determined. Finally, a feedforward ANN using the LM backpropagation algorithm was trained with the data measured from 0-, 1.5-, 3-, 4.5-, and 6-cm heights from the magnetic material; and the voltage values measured from 3- and 6-cm heights from the magnetic material were provided to the ANN as inputs, respectively, and thus, the voltage values for the same material at 0-cm height were found. Thereby, the upper surface image of the material could be determined by the same way as that obtained from 0-cm height even though the sensor series is at a different position compared with the soil surface through the ANN developed. Although many magnetic materials were tested, the results of a cuboid and a cylindrical material were provided within the scope of our study article and the performance of the ANN was discussed. In addition, the success of the ANN in different soil mixtures was confirmed for these two materials.

AB  - This work presents a real-time approach to the detection, isolation, and prediction of component failures in large-scale systems through the combination of two modules. The modules themselves are then used in conjunction with an inference engine, TEAMS-RT, which is part of Qualtech Systems integrated diagnostic toolset, to provide the end user with accurate diagnostic and prognostic information about the state of the system. The first module is a filter used to "clean" observed test results from multiple sensors from system noise. The sensors have false alarm and missed detection probabilities that are not known a-priori, and must be estimated - ideally along with the accuracies of these estimates - online, within the inference engine. Further, recognizing a practical concern in most real systems, a sparsely instantiated observation vector must not be problematic. Multiple hypothesis tracking (MHT) is at the heart of the filtering algorithm and beta prior distributions are applied to the sensor errors. The second module is a prognostic engine that uses an interacting multiple model (IMM) approach to track the "trajectory" of degrading sensors. Kalman filters estimate the movement in each dimension of the sensors. The current state and trajectory of each sensor is then used to predict the time to failure value, i.e., when the component corresponding to the sensor is no longer usable. The modules are integrated together and as part of the TEAMS-RT suite; logic is presented for the cases that they disagree.

AB  - A decision tree algorithm for fault detection and isolation of additive sensor faults in an inertial measurement unit (IMU) is presented. The algorithm is trained and validated using real measurements with an extended Kalman filter (EKF) implemented on hardware in a production vehicle. The measurement data is cleaned from faulty measurements using different clustering algorithms , i.e., K-means, hierarchical clustering and density based clustering for applications with noise (DBSCAN). Then, decision tree models are trained based on the output estimates of an EKF using the original IMU data. Two different classification problems are considered. First, the binary classification problem distinguishing between the cases nominal and faulty is considered. Second, the multi-class classification problem distinguishing between errors in all three acceleration and angular velocity signals is considered.

AB  - To predict the NOx emission level precisely in power station boiler, a data-driven method is presented to solve the problem of the absence of precision model. In this method, the operating data is utilized sufficiently to establish the model based on statistical learning theory. Firstly, the data on field is cleaned to avoid noise and abnormal value. To find the optimal model parameters, genetic algorithm is used for model optimization. So a modeling method is presented to describe the NOx emission level during varying load. The simulation is implemented on a 300MW coal-fired unit with several different working loads, and compared to the way based on neural network, the results show that the model can predict the NOx emission more precisely, which provides the foundation for further operating optimization.

AB  - One well-known difficulty in creating an effective human-machine interface via the speech input is the adverse effects of concurrent acoustic noise. To overcome this challenge, we have developed a joint hardware and software solution. A novel bone-conductive microphone is integrated with a regular air-conductive one in a single headset. These two simultaneous sensors capture the distinct signal properties in the speech embedded in acoustic noise. The focus of this paper is the exploration of the type of dynamic properties that are relatively invariant between the bone-conductive sensor's signal and the clean speech signal; the latter would not be available to the recognizer. Our approach is based on a nonlinear processing technique that estimates the unobserved (hidden) vocal tract resonances, as a representation of such invariant hidden dynamics, from the available bone-sensor signal. The information about these dynamic aspects of the clean speech is then fused with the other noisy measurements that aims to improve the recognition system's robustness to acoustic distortion. The fusion technique is based on a combination of three sets of signals including the synthesized speech signal using the vocal tract resonance dynamics extracted nonlinearly from the bone-sensor signal.

AB  - This paper presents a novel approach, adaptive spectrum noise cancellation (ASNC), for motion artifacts removal in photoplethysmography (PPG) signals measured by an optical biosensor to obtain clean PPG waveforms for heartbeat rate calculation. One challenge faced by this optical sensing method is the inevitable noise induced by movement when the user is in motion, especially when the motion frequency is very close to the target heartbeat rate. The proposed ASNC utilizes the onboard accelerometer and gyroscope sensors to detect and remove the artifacts adaptively, thus obtaining accurate heartbeat rate measurement while in motion. The ASNC algorithm makes use of a commonly accepted spectrum analysis approaches in medical digital signal processing, discrete cosine transform, to carry out frequency domain analysis. Results obtained by the proposed ASNC have been compared with the classic algorithms, the adaptive threshold peak detection and adaptive noise cancellation. The mean (standard deviation) absolute error and mean relative error of heartbeat rate calculated by ASNC is 0.33 (0.57) beats min-1 and 0.65%, by adaptive threshold peak detection algorithm is 2.29 (2.21) beats min-1 and 8.38%, by adaptive noise cancellation algorithm is 1.70 (1.50) beats min-1 and 2.02%. While all algorithms performed well with both simulated PPG data and clean PPG data collected from our verity device in situations free of motion artifacts, ASNC provided better accuracy when motion artifacts increase, especially when motion frequency is very close to the heartbeat rate.

AB  - This paper deals with the improvement of a noisy speech enhancement system based on the fusion of auditory and visual information. The system was presented in previous papers and implemented with a simple stimuli corrupted with white noise. Its principle consists of an analysis-enhancement-synthesis process based on a linear prediction (LP) model of the signal: the LP filter is enhanced thanks to associative tools that estimate the LP cleaned parameters from both noisy audio and lip shape information. The structure of the system is reviewed and we focus on the improvement that concerns the associators: multi-layers perceptrons are used instead of linear regression. It is shown that in the context of VCV transitions corrupted with white noise, the performances of the system are improved in terms of the intelligibility gain, distance measures and classification tests.

AB  - Depth perception is considered an invaluable source of information for various vision tasks. However, depth maps acquired using consumer-level sensors still suffer from non-negligible noise. This fact has recently motivated researchers to exploit traditional filters, as well as the deep learning paradigm, in order to suppress the aforementioned non-uniform noise, while preserving geometric details. Despite the effort, deep depth denoising is still an open challenge mainly due to the lack of clean data that could be used as ground truth. In this paper, we propose a fully convolutional deep autoencoder that learns to denoise depth maps, surpassing the lack of ground truth data. Specifically, the proposed autoencoder exploits multiple views of the same scene from different points of view in order to learn to suppress noise in a self-supervised end-to-end manner using depth and color information during training, yet only depth during inference. To enforce self-supervision, we leverage a differentiable rendering technique to exploit photometric supervision, which is further regularized using geometric and surface priors. As the proposed approach relies on raw data acquisition, a large RGB-D corpus is collected using Intel RealSense sensors. Complementary to a quantitative evaluation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed self-supervised denoising approach on established 3D reconstruction applications.

AB  - Describes a noise-resistant pulse oximetry algorithm suited to both signal reconstruction and oxygen saturation estimation. The algorithm first detects relatively clean signal sections from which the heart rate is estimated. The heart rate is used to construct a synthetic reference signal that matches an idealized pulse signal. An adaptive filter continuously processes the sensor signals, reconstructing signals in a linear subspace defined by the reference signal. A projective subspace algorithm is then applied to find the oxygenation level of the blood. The authors show that under specific circumstances this algorithm solves the sufficiency condition for signal reconstruction in linear saturation estimators. The core principle of using a frequency modulated synthetic reference signal can be applied to adaptive filtering of other physiological signals controlled by the heartbeat, such as blood pressure and electrocardiogram.

AB  - With the rapid development of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), sensor and wireless technologies, a large amount of trajectory data of moving objects are emerging, and trajectory data mining has received more and more attentions recently. However, since the data collected by sensors and RFID readers are usually noisy, it is necessary and meaningful to clean up the noise, including missing detection events and cross detection events, so as to provide high quality data for various applications using trajectory data. Cleaning up the trajectory events should take into account of uncertainty of location and unreliability of event detection at the same time. In the paper, we first discuss the rules to distinguish between normal detection events and false detection events in the trajectories, using constraints on continuous motion between adjacent detection regions and direct moving time between neighboring physical regions. Then, as a unified cleaning framework, we establish a probabilistic region connection graph to represent region detection features, region connection relationships, and region transition probabilities of neighboring physical regions. Focusing on interpolating missing events, we suggest two path-based probabilistic interpolating strategies, namely, the Most Likely Path (MLP) strategy and the Highest Weighting Probability Path (HWPP) strategy. Also, we discuss pruning rules of candidate paths for reducing computational cost. Finally, we conduct experiments over simulation data to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed methods.

AB  - In this paper, two models, the I-vector and the Gaussian Mixture Model-Universal Background Model (GMM-UBM), are compared for the speaker identification task. Four feature combinations of I-vectors with seven fusion techniques are considered: maximum, mean, weighted sum, cumulative, interleaving and concatenated for both two and four features. In addition, an Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is exploited to identify speakers, and then Speaker Identification Accuracy (SIA) is calculated. Both systems are evaluated for 120 speakers from the TIMIT and NIST 2008 databases for clean speech. Furthermore, a comprehensive evaluation is made under Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) conditions and with three types of Non Stationary Noise (NSN), both with and without handset effects for the TIMIT database. The results show that the I-vector approach is better than the GMM-UBM for both clean and AWGN conditions without a handset. However, the GMM-UBM had better accuracy for NSN types.

AB  - This paper presents the high building mirror cleaning robot control system (HMCR) which is the first step toward a complete implementation of the fully of intelligent exterior building cleaning system (IEBCS). Examples for these techniques are outdoor robots. The system can have three main importance roles that first for detected the signals from mirror detection areas such as image quantity and dirty level relatively with the sensor positions and after that compression process are proposed the image coding algorithms called wavelet transform with system error compensate via vector quantization techniques (VQ). The small bit rates for high-speed data transmission with a small space for data storage are required on wireless transceiver channel. Simultaneously, the peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) has to be maintained. The shape analysis with a continuous thinning algorithms are used in second step for reduced the sized of data and can be representatives for suitable features data. Finally the cleaning algorithms are designed both for normally mode and intelligent mode that applied by fuzzy rule based algorithms on the programmable logic controller (PLC) with fuzzy ladder control technique (FLC). By applying the proposed method, performance has been improved which indicated by lower bit rate and better PSNR. Some results from natural scenes are shown that system performance can work well and is valid to detect the other kinds of mirror area that would train the mobile robot to perform some task at that place.

AB  - An assessment of electrocardiogram (ECG) signal quality has become an unavoidable first step in most holter and ambulatory ECG signal analysis applications. In this paper, we present a simple method for automatically detection and classification of ECG noises. The proposed method consists of four major steps: moving average filter, blocking, feature extraction, and multistage decision-tree algorithm. In the proposed method, the dynamic amplitude range and autocorrelation maximum peak features are extracted for each block. In the first decision stage, a amplitude-dependent decision rule is used for detecting the presence of low-frequency (LF) noise (including, baseline wander (BW) and abrupt change (ABC) artifacts) and the high-frequency (HF) noise (including, power line interference (PLI) and muscle artifacts). In the second decision stage, the proposed method further classifies the LF noise into a BW noise or a ABC noise using the local dynamic amplitude range feature. The HF noise is classified into a PLI noise or a muscle noise using the local autocorrelation maximum peak feature. The proposed detection and classification method is tested and validated using a wide variety of clean and noisy ECG signals. Results show that the method can achieve an average sensitivity (Se) of 97.88%, positive productivity (+P) of 91.18% and accuracy of 89.06%.

AB  - A laser absorption sensor for carbon monoxide concentration was developed for combustion studies in a rapid compression machine using a pulsed quantum cascade laser near 4.89 μm. Cavity enhancement reduced minimum detection limit down to 2.4 ppm at combustion relevant conditions. Off-axis alignment and rapid intra-pulse down-chirp resulted in effective suppression of cavity noise.

AB  - Wireless communications employing 60 GHz millimeter wave are quite attractive recently due to the huge clean unlicensed bandwidth (up to 7 GHz) in this frequency band. In this paper, aiming at increasing channel capacity and improving the reliability of non-line-of-sight (NLOS) indoor wireless communications, we focus on a first-order-reflection multiple input multiple output (MIMO) model for 60 GHz wireless local area network (WLAN) systems based on the short-range indoor scenario provided by IEEE Std 802.11ad. Considering the special physical properties of 60 GHz millimeter wave in such scenario, we use large scale planar antenna arrays at both transmitter and receiver to eliminate link level interference. The antenna arrays are divided into several sub-arrays and each sub-array is considered as a high-gain steerable directional antenna unit. The essential characteristics of the physical layer of this model is to adjust these antenna units along different first-order-reflection clusters from walls or ceiling simultaneously at both transmitter and receiver to get several parallel channel links. System level simulation results demonstrate that the proposed model with multiple first-order-reflection links can increase the channel capacity for several times compared to the original model in this scenario.

AB  - Hyperspectral images (HSIs) are usually corrupted by various noises, e.g., Gaussian noise, impulse noise, stripes, dead lines, and many others. In this article, motivated by the good performance of the L1-2 nonconvex metric in image sparse structure exploitation, we first develop a 3-D L1-2 spatial-spectral total variation ( L1-2SSTV) regularization to globally represent the sparse prior in the gradient domain of HSIs. Then, we divide HSIs into local overlapping 3-D patches, and low-rank tensor recovery (LTR) is locally used to effectively separate the low-rank clean HSI patches from complex noise. The patchwise LTR can not only adapt to the local low-rank property of HSIs well but also significantly reduce the information loss caused by the global LTR. Finally, integrating the advantages of both the global L1-2SSTV regularization and local LTR model, we propose a L1-2SSTV regularized local LTR model for hyperspectral restoration. In the framework of the alternating direction method of multipliers, the difference of convex algorithm, the split Bregman iteration method, and tensor singular value decomposition method are adopted to solve the proposed model efficiently. Simulated and real HSI experiments show that the proposed model can reduce the dependence on noise independent and identical distribution hypotheses, and simultaneously remove various types of noise, even structure-related noise.

AB  - Physiological features extraction from Motion Artifacts (MA) corrupted Photoplethysmography (PPG) signals are of great difficulty due to the non-linear interaction between clean PPG and noise. To accurately extract features such as heart rate, blood pressure, and Oxygen Saturation in Blood, a robust PPG de-noising and waveform recovering method is required. However, traditional adaptive filtering or signal decomposition methods fail to achieve this goal. In this paper, a Signal-Noise Interaction modeling based algorithm for motion artifacts removal (SniMA) under strenuous physical exercise utilizing Envelope Filtering (EF) and Time-Delay Neural Network (TDNN) is proposed. Envelope Filtering normalizes raw data and eliminates imbalance training problem for neural networks, while TDNN is a hidden-state included method aiming at modeling PPG signal-noise interaction. An accelerometer as well as a gyroscope functions as the noise reference. Results comparing 8 performance indexes extracted from 4 types of waveform related features (heart rate, waveform correlation, pulse width, and pulse area) on an open access dataset we built show SniMA's effectiveness for PPG MA removal. The proposed algorithm provides a significant improvement in PPG waveform recovery and PPG feature estimation accuracy. This is the first time that a TDNN has been introduced for PPG de-noising. This study also indicates the potential of other hidden-state involved signal-noise interaction modeling methods for PPG de-noising.

AB  - Conventional radar-based people counting systems are designed mainly for dense spatial distributions in a small region of interest (ROI). Therefore, a system with only conventional energy-based features, which are effective for a small ROI with a limited spatial distribution of individuals, generally fails to cope with the diverse and complex spatial distributions that arise from the freer movements of individuals as the ROI widens. To address this problem, a novel approach that achieves robust people counting in both wide and small ROIs is presented in this study. The proposed technique incorporates modified CLEAN-based features in the range domain and energy-based features in the frequency domain to efficiently address both dense and dispersed distributions of individuals. Subsequently, principal component analysis and an appropriate normalization of the proposed features are performed for improving the people counting system further. Based on several experiments in practical environments with wide ROIs and severe multipath effects, we observed that the proposed approach yields significantly improved performance compared with traditional people counting systems.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to remove the Gaussian Noise present in seismic signals obtained in the Llaima volcano, one of the most active volcanoes in Chile. In order to classify subsequently, the methods used to clean the seismic signals are usually band pass Butterworth filter for its low ripple to reduce interference from other sources of mechanical energy to provide low frequency components. However, these methods are unable to eliminate white Gaussian noise present in seismic signal samples, which affects the observation signals that are too weak to show slightly above the noise, thereby preventing classification. The methods used in this study to eliminate the white noise spectral subtraction are consisting of narrow samples and then subtract noise in the frequency domain and the modified Wiener filter that using the statistical method of least squares generates clarification signal. When comparing both methods, it was observed that the Wiener filter has greater effectiveness in cleaning the noise when owning an iterative noise estimation. The development of these methods applied to the investigation of seismic signals provides information of seismic events that are of low intensity for further observation.

AB  - Recent studies have made great progress on skeleton-based action recognition. However, most of them are developed with relatively clean skeletons without the presence of intensive noise. We argue that the models learned from relatively clean data are not well generalizable to handle noisy skeletons commonly appeared in the real world. In this paper, we address the challenge of recognizing human actions from noisy skeletons, which is seldom explored by previous methods. Beyond exploring the new problem, we further take a new perspective to address it, i.e., noise adaptation, which gets rid of explicit skeleton noise modeling and reliance on skeleton ground truths. Specifically, we develop regression-based and generation-based adaptation models according to whether pairs of noisy skeletons are available. The regression-based model aims to learn noise-suppressed intrinsic feature representations by mapping pairs of noisy skeletons into a noise-robust space. When only unpaired skeletons are accessible, the generation-based model aims to adapt the features from noisy skeletons to a low-noise space by adversarial learning. To verify our proposed model and facilitate research on noisy skeletons, we collect a new dataset Noisy Skeleton Dataset (NSD), the skeletons of which are with much noise and more similar to daily-life data than previous datasets. Extensive experiments are conducted on the NSD, VV-RGBD and N-UCLA datasets, and results consistently show the outstanding performance of our proposed model.

AB  - Heart sound is a valuable biosignal for early detection of a large set of cardiac diseases. Ambient and physiological noise interference is one of the most usual and high probable incidents during heart sound acquisition. It may change the prominent and crucial characteristics of heart sound which may possess important information for heart disease diagnosis. In this paper, we propose a new method to detect ambient and internal body noises in heart sounds. The algorithm utilizes physiologically inspired periodicity/semi-periodicity criteria. A small segment of clean heart sound exhibiting periodicity in the time and in the frequency domain is first detected. The sound segment is used as a template to detect uncontaminated heart sounds during recording. The technique has been tested on the heart sounds contaminated with several types of noises, recorded from 68 different subjects. Average sensitivity of 95.13% and specificity of 98.65% for non-cardiac sound detection were achieved.

AB  - This paper presents an adaptive notch filter to achieve more accurate demodulation variables in the method of averaging. The main advantage of this notch filter is a very sharp attenuation gain at twice of the estimated resonance frequency, which is the main frequency component of the oscillatory noise in the demodulated variables. The position of the sharp attenuation gain can be adjusted in real time to catch the resonator's resonance frequency change. As a result, it can demodulate the control variables up to very high accuracy. Performing the method of averaging on the cleaner signals will result in much higher rotation angle estimation accuracy when the method of averaging is running in the whole angle mode. Simulation results show that with the adaptive notch filter, the oscillation in the system's quadrature and precession angle can be eliminated very well. The adaptive notch filter also effectively reduces the DC drift in the precession angle.

AB  - Given a sensor network, TDOA self-calibration aims at simultaneously estimating the positions of receivers and transmitters, and transmitters time offsets. This can be formulated as a system of polynomial equations. Due to the elevated number of unknowns and the nonlinearity of the problem, obtaining an accurate solution efficiently is nontrivial. Previous work has shown that iterative algorithms are sensitive to initialization and little noise can lead to failure in convergence. Hence, research has focused on algebraic techniques. Stable and efficient algebraic solvers have been proposed for some network configurations, but they do not work for smaller networks. In this paper, we use homotopy continuation to solve four previously unsolved configurations in 2D TDOA self-calibration, including a minimal one. As a theoretical contribution, we investigate the number of solutions of the new minimal configuration, showing this is much lower than previous estimates. As a more practical contribution, we also present new subminimal solvers, which can be used to achieve unique accurate solutions in previously unsolvable configurations. We demonstrate our solvers are stable both with clean and noisy data, even without nonlinear refinement afterwards. Moreover, we demonstrate the suitability of homotopy continuation for sensor network calibration problems, opening prospects to new applications.

AB  - This paper presents an image destriping system for correcting striping noise of remote-sensing images. The developed system identifies stripe positions based on edge-detection and line-tracing algorithms. Pixels not affected by striping are used as control points to construct cubic spline functions describing spatial gray level distributions of an image. Detected stripes are corrected by replacing the pixels with more reasonable gray values computed from constructed spline functions. Gray values of clean pixels not affected by stripes are not altered to preserve data genuineness. Several experimental results demonstrate that the developed system can correctly detect stripes in remote-sensing images and effectively repair them. Evaluations of the results based on an quantitative image quality index indicate that the image quality has been improved significantly after destriping. The destriped images are not only visually more plausible but also can provide better interpretability and are more suitable for computerized analysis.

AB  - The present contribution concerns the activities carried out in the Clean Sky GRC5 MANOEUVRES project. The overall goal of the project is to provide an innovative system to monitor rotorcraft noise in flight, in view of performing optimized low-noise terminal procedures. To achieve this goal it is necessary to estimate in real time the main rotor tip-path plane (TPP) orientation with respect to the vehicle airspeed vector, which in turn depends on the TPP orientation with respect to the helicopter airframe. An in-flight contactless measuring system, capable of measuring the three angles of a helicopter blade with respect to the hub, is proposed and validated. Its development is detailed, starting from the selection of candidate technologies up to the final demonstration of a prototypal device on board an AgustaWestland AW139 prototype helicopter.
