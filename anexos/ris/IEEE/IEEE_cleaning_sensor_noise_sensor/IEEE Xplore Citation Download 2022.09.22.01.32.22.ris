AB  - In this paper, a recursion subspace-based method (RSM) is presented to estimate the bearings of incident signals impinging on a uniform linear array (ULA). Unlike the existing linear operation based methods, such as the signal subspace method without eigendecomposition (SUMWE) of Xin et al, that calculate the noise subspace, the RSM method finds a cleaner signal subspace by means of a successive recursion procedure. Thus, the RSM method has the advantages of computational simplicity and accurate estimation, in particular for a large array. Numerical results are presented to compare the performance the RSM method with that of the SUMWE methods.

AB  - Point clouds acquired from scanning devices are often perturbed by noise, which affects downstream tasks such as surface reconstruction and analysis. The distribution of a noisy point cloud can be viewed as the distribution of a set of noise-free samples p(x) convolved with some noise model n, leading to (p * n)(x) whose mode is the underlying clean surface. To denoise a noisy point cloud, we propose to increase the log-likelihood of each point from p * n via gradient ascent—iteratively updating each point’s position. Since p * n is unknown at test-time, and we only need the score (i.e., the gradient of the log-probability function) to perform gradient ascent, we propose a neural network architecture to estimate the score of p * n given only noisy point clouds as input. We derive objective functions for training the network and develop a denoising algorithm leveraging on the estimated scores. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods under a variety of noise models, and shows the potential to be applied in other tasks such as point cloud upsampling.

AB  - We have developed an artificial neural network (ANN) based carbonate detector capable of running on current and future rover hardware. The detector can identify calcite in visible/NIR (350-2500 nm) spectra of both laboratory specimens covered by ferric dust and rocks in Mars analogue field environments. The ANN was trained using the backpropagation algorithm with sigmoid activation neurons. For the training dataset, we chose nine carbonate and eight noncarbonate representative mineral spectra from the USGS spectral library. Using these spectra as seeds, we generated 10,000 variants with up to 2% Gaussian noise in each reflectance measurement. We cross-validated several ANN architectures, training on 9,900 spectra and testing on the remaining 100. The best performing ANN correctly detected, with perfect accuracy, the presence (or absence) of carbonate in spectral data taken on field samples from the Mojave desert and clean, pure marbles from CT. Sensitivity experiments with JSC Mars-1 simulant dust suggest the carbonate detector would perform well in aeolian Martian environments.

AB  - Electricity and appliance usage information can often reveal the nature of human activities in a home. For instance, sensing the use of vacuum cleaner, a microwave oven, and kitchen appliances can give insights into a person's current activities. Instead of putting a sensor on each appliance, our technique is based on the idea that appliance usage can be sensed by their manifestations in an environment's existing electrical infrastructure. Prior approaches using this technique could only detect an appliance's on-off states; that is, they only sense “what” is being used, but not “how” it is used. In this paper, we introduce DOSE, a significant advancement for inferring operating states of electronic devices from a single sensing point in a home. When an electronic device is in operation, it generates time-varying Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) based upon its operating states (e.g., vacuuming on a rug vs. hardwood floor). This EMI noise is coupled to the power line and can be picked up from a single sensing hardware attached to the wall outlet in a house. Unlike prior data-driven approaches, we employ domain knowledge of the device's circuitry for semi-supervised model training to avoid tedious labeling process. We evaluated DOSE in a residential house for 2 months and found that operating states for 16 appliances could be estimated with an average accuracy of 93.8%. These fine-grained electrical characteristics affords rich feature sets of electrical events and have the potential to support various applications such as in-home activity inference, energy disaggregation and device failure detection.

AB  - We studied how to control the frequencies of those simple crystals used in typical telecommunication transmitter. According to the common standards, the uncertainty of carrier frequency should be less than 0.3 ppm. That of simple XO is only 100 ppm. Two approaches have been studied here. The first one is the German transmitter DCF 77. The second one is the utilization of the NTP-time servers. We studied phase distribution and calculated Allan variances, both for raw data and cleaned data. Three-standard-deviation-criterion was applied to detect outliers. The results point out, that usually DFC 77 enables sufficient phase locking in a couple of seconds. The main problem is the atmospheric noise during thunderstorms in the late summer seasons. The NTP-time servers suffer from 100 mus level time jumps. Typically the 10 min integration time is needed to achieve the 0.3 ppm accuracy. Therefore, some kind of temperature compensation of those XOs is needed to fulfill the requirements.

AB  - Background noise reduction has been studied for many years. However, unwanted human speech noise suppression is not well discussed due to sparsity of the speech signal. Traditional blind source separation (BSS) methods such as independent component analysis (ICA) assume the prior knowledge of the number of sources and require that the number of sources must equal the number of sensors. Above limitations prevent the practical use of speech enhancement using traditional BSS for mobile phone communication. In this paper, a combination method of BSS and speaker recognition system (SRS) is developed for target speech extraction in underdetermined cases. By estimating each independent speech from speech mixture using binary mask over time-frequency (T- F) domain, clean speeches can be separated. By comparing Mel frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) of each separated clean speech with the trained MFCC, distortions can be calculated out. The separated clean speech with the smallest distortion is regarded as the target speech. Through a series of validations, optimum parameters for BSS and SRS are obtained. Additionally, the proposed method shows robustness in human-generated background noise suppression.

The work presents an ultra-low-power bio-potential acquisition and 11b successive approximation register (SAR) analog to digital converter (ADC) to acquire clean ECG signal and digitized data for further on-sensor processing, respectively. The designed low-noise amplifier (LNA) targets a wearable environment utilizing an AC coupled chopper technique to reject rail-to-rail electrode DC offset (EDO), 50/60 Hz interference, and mitigate flicker noise. The proposed analog front end (AFE) is implemented utilizing a CMOS 180nm technology and consumes 1.3uA of current while operating @ 1V. The system achieves NEF and input-referred noise of 2.67 and 50nV/&#x221A;Hz, respectively, with an effective number of bits (ENOB) of 10.1.

AB  - A new wavelet-based multi-feature voiced/unvoiced speech classification algorithm is presented. The algorithm is based on statistical analysis of wavelet-based frequency distribution of the average energy, zero-crossing rate, and average energy of short-time segments of the speech signal. The algorithm first classifies the input speech into voiced, unvoiced and uncertain parts by comparing features with predetermined thresholds. Then, the uncertain parts are treated in three conditions and dynamic thresholds are computed by extracted features of the input signal. Finally, the dynamic thresholds are used to classify the uncertain parts. The performance of the algorithm has been evaluated using a large speech database. The algorithm is shown to perform well in the cases of both clean and noise-degraded speech.

AB  - This work is dedicated to developing a novel three dimensional structure for electrochemical measurements in neuronal studies. The final prototype will allow not only for the study and culture on chip of neuronal cells, but also of brain tissue. The use of out-of-plane electrodes instead of planar ones increases the sensitivity of the system and increases the signal-to-noise ratio in the recorded signals, due to the higher availability of surface area. The main bottleneck of the out-of-plane electrode fabrication lies in the metallization process for transforming them into active electrodes, since the coverage of the side walls of almost vertical pillars is not trivial by standard processes in a clean room facility. This paper will discuss the different steps taken towards this goal and present the results that we have obtained so far.

AB  - We consider the problem of assigning a class label to the noisy output of a linear system, where clean feature examples are available for training. We design a robust classifier that operates on a linear estimate, with uncertainty modeled by a Gaussian distribution with parameters derived from the bias and covariance of a linear estimator. Class-conditional distributions are modeled locally as Gaussians. Since estimation of Gaussian parameters from few training samples can be illposed, we extend recent work in Bayesian quadratic discriminant analysis to derive a robust local generative classifier. Experiments show a statistically significant improvement over prior art.

AB  - Denoising is the representative task in hyperspectral image (HSI) processing. This letter proposes to produce a classification-driven HSI denoiser, which is capable of simultaneously reducing noise and preserving semantic-aware detail. The conditional neural adversarial network and multiple loss functions are introduced to produce visually pleasing images by enforcing an additional constraint that the denoised image must be indistinguishable from its corresponding ground-truth clean image. Experiments are performed on hyperspectral remote sensing images containing both the simulated hybrid noise and real noise. The results show that the proposed model outperforms many state-of-the-art denoising methods for HSIs.

AB  - In this article, we present a new development with test results on the sonar uncertainty model and the relevant processing of the interferometric bathymetry sounding data. Within a sonar sounding solution, not only an angle and time-delay pair is resolved, but quality factor, angle uncertainty and signal to noise ratio (SNR), with which the angle solution is obtained, are provided as well for the completeness of the data fields required for post processing. The goal is to generate a final sounding with registered uncertainties in three dimensions. As a result, the quality factor and SNR are applied to eliminate the low quality angle solutions due to backscatter from either multiple path or shadow area. The cleaned angle and time delay pair is then used for the estimation of the local depth, registered with the depth uncertainty derived from the angle uncertainty. The resolved depth plus its uncertainty, along with data from other sensors (IMU and SVP) and their related uncertainties, are processed by the Combined Uncertainty and Bathymetry Estimator (CUBE) [1] to generate a final mapping solution registered by a total propagated uncertainty to be checked against IHO S-44 at different order levels. From another view point, the SNR is a measurement of both the signal quality at each spatial sample and the coherence between the data streams from different bathymetric transducer receive staves. The coherence measurement is helpful to determine the valid angle apart from the nadir from which a robust sounding solution can be obtained in a full ping. It is evident that the SNR streams computed from different receiver pairs start to converge from an angle α apart from the nadir. The angle solutions within α would be considered as only fine quality due to the de-correlation introduced by different spacing among the receive staves. Conventionally, sonar manufacturers specify angles ~35 deg to start processing the data. However, with the new capability, α is determined from real-time data and is adaptively adjusted in situ based on the bottom, depth, motion, and other acoustic environments. First, a Sonar Uncertainty Model is presented. It is a Simulink (Matlab) package composed of Sonar Simulation Toolsets (Applied Physics Lab, University of Washington, Seattle), Klein Bathymetry Engine, and statistical processing. Second, in a cooperative effort with the Center for Coastal and Ocean Mapping/Joint Hydrographic Center (CCOM/JHC), sea trial data has been processed to evaluate the uncertainty model. Third, a full data set collected from Portsmouth, N.H. by a Klein HydroChart 5000 has been processed by CARIS through CUBE application. Analysis results are discussed and demonstrated.

AB  - The identification of parameters of spatially variant blurs given a clean image and its blurry noisy version is a challenging inverse problem of interest in many application fields, such as biological microscopy and astronomical imaging. In this paper, we consider a parametric form for the blur and introduce a state-space model that describes the statistical dependence among the neighboring kernels. Our Bayesian approach aims at estimating the posterior distributions of the kernel parameters given the available data. Since those posteriors are not tractable due to the nonlinearities of the model, we propose a sequential Monte Carlo approach to approximate the distributions by processing the data in an online manner. This allows to consider numerous overlapped patches and large scale images at reasonable computational and memory costs. Moreover, it provides a measure of uncertainty due to the Bayesian framework. Practical experimental results illustrate the good performance of our novel approach, emphasizing the benefit to exploit the spatial structure for an improved estimation quality.

AB  - In this paper, we propose a real-time hand gesture recognition system, using a thinning method which utilizes a stereo camera and implements a Korean chess game system. We implement a depth map in the hand detection portion which uses the sum of absolute differences method, based on the acquired right-left image of detecting the foreground object. We use a convex hull to detect the regions of interest (ROI) and calculate the depth of the object in the ROI in order to obtain more accurate hand images. Then, we remove the background image in the ROI and get the foreground image as a hand image. Finally, we use a blob-labeling method to obtain the clean hand image, without the noise caused by computing distance from stereo matching. The hand gesture recognition system uses the Zhang and Suen thinning algorithm to obtain feature point, angle and distance. This system recognizes five types of hand gestures. The proposed method achieves an average recognition rate of 83%. At last, we applied the gesture recognition result to the Korean chess game system which can move the chess pieces by hand.

AB  - The problem of image noise is prevalent in various visual recognition tasks. This problem arises due to multiple factors like insufficient illumination, low-quality camera sensors, background-clutters, etc. Low-quality images incur degraded performance for visual recognition tasks like classification, object detection, because of the noise present in the image. Thus, mostly the latest image recognition benchmarks and methods, such as Pascal Visual Object Classes Challenges and Microsoft Common Objects in Context Challenges, rely primarily on clean and high-definition images. Furthermore, image noise is a typical problem in real-time applications like surveillance, autonomous vehicles, etc. To tackle this bothersome problem of underperformance of visual recognition tasks, particularly object detection, due to inclusion of noise in real-time scenarios, a technique has been proposed to reduce the image noise's impact on the object detection task and improve its performance altogether. A two-phase pipeline is introduced, in which the first phase consists ofremoving noise from the low-quality image, and the second stage includes accomplishing the object detection process by employing the standard Single-shot multibox object detector. The proposed approach is evaluated on the Pascal Visual Object Classes benchmark. The detection results and image denoising results exhibit the efficiency of the proposed technique for reliable object detection with varying image noise levels.

AB  - NASA continuously monitors spacecraft surfaces to assure a very low presence of bacterial endospores upon landing on the surface of Mars. In order to meet the rigid schedules of spacecraft assembly, a more rapid, sensitive spore detection assay is being considered as an alternate method to the current three-day NASA standard culture-based assay. The millipore microstar rapid system (RMDS) has been used successfully for rapid bioburden enumeration in a wide range of applications. It combines membrane filtration, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) bioluminescence chemistry, and image analysis based on photon detection with a charge coupled device (CCD) camera. The RMDS is rapid and simple, shows high sensitivity (1 colony forming unit [CFU]/sample), and correlates excellently with traditional culture-based methods. In addition, by utilizing the milliflex filtration system, the RMDS is ideal for sampling both large sample volumes and those samples containing inhibitory substances. In this study, we have evaluated the use of the RMDS as a rapid spore detection tool for NASA planetary protection applications. This is accomplished by preceding the RMDS incubation protocol with a heat shock step, 15 minutes at 80degC, as a direct selection of spores. Different luciferase enzymes were tested in order to reduce the typical 18-24 hour incubation time to ~5 hours. Of the reagents evaluated, a formulation of a highly sensitive bioluminescence reagent was found to be more sensitive than the present millipore microstar reagents. Assay times of ~5 hours were repeatedly demonstrated along with low image background noise. In order to evaluate the applicability of this method, seven species of Bacillus (nine strains) that have been repeatedly isolated from clean room environments were assayed. All strains were detected in ~5 hours. The improved RMDS-based spore detection is under validation and is expected to achieve the goal of "same shift" measurement of spore bioburden during spacecraft assembly

AB  - This paper proposes a novel method to estimate heart rate variability (HRV) and interbeat interval (IBI) in the presence of motion artifacts. A robust heartbeat selection method is introduced as a shortest path exploration problem to detect HRV/IBI from a noisy signal. The time-continuity of heartbeats is used to model the shortest path. The end point of one heartbeat is the starting point of the next one. A graph is constructed whose vertices and edges are assumed to be the beginning of each possible heartbeats and the IBIs, respectively. Weights are assigned to the edges by using average heart rate (HR) values from state-of-the-art algorithms. The results indicate that IBI percentage error is around 3% for distorted ECG signal even with 0dB SNR. In addition, HRV parameters of clean versus noisy signals show high correlation.

AB  - The current trend in embedded systems is to make them surrounding the users, providing services thanks to a knowledge of their environment. These self-awareness and context-awareness properties are provided by numerous sensors, from different types. Using the provided information causes at least two problems: the fusion of data from different sources, and the noise induced by sensors which are closer from the processing unit than ever. Additionally, the needed applications that use these information are based on different recognition processings, sometimes not easy to formalize with conventional algorithms. Processing chains using neural-based algorithms are promising approaches for solving these kinds of issues. Unfortunately, embedding bio-inspired algorithms in an embedded system is not so easy since there is no exploration environment for this specific task. Moreover, neural networks often need pre- or postprocessing of data for optimal operation. In fact, there is a balance to find between pre-processing and neural network processing: for example, adding more filtering to clean or to transform data (like convolution filters or FFT) enables to have smaller neural networks, leading to less number of neurons, less learning time and finally more efficient applications. This paper presents early results of a collaboration towards the design of such an exploration environment coming from a joint laboratory between an SME and a Research Institute. The main object coming from the current collaboration is the coupling of a rich exploration environnement of embedded systems (including multi/manycore) with a neural network exploration tool. The combination of the two enables us to have feedbacks concerning both algorithm efficiency and performances and other non-functional metrics regarding the target system for driving the co-design cycle of industrial embedded systems.

AB  - A numerical simulator is developed to assess various design implications of a digital correlator used by a synthetic aperture interferometric radiometer (SAIR). The simulator permits control of the type of digitization, the digitization thresholds with respect to noise power, and the degree of correlation between the two antenna signals which are being cross correlated. Digitization schemes are considered which use 2, 3, 4, and 8 levels. Estimates are made of the increase in inherent radiometer noise (/spl Delta/T) due to the digitization. The increase in /spl Delta/T is found to depend strongly on the degree of correlation, with higher correlations suffering less increase. In most cases, 3 level digitization is recommended based on this sensitivity consideration. Two levels perform significantly noisier and four levels only slightly cleaner. Several case studies are also considered regarding the need to control the signal level relative to the digitizer thresholds. Automatic gain control circuitry prior to digitization is found not to be necessary, provided the thresholds are preset within a fairly broad region of minimum sensitivity to variations in signal power, and provided the system noise temperature of the radiometer is monitored with reasonable accuracy. It is also found that, under conditions of very high correlation between the two signals, digital correlators have better SNR performance than analog. Reasons for this behavior are discussed.<>

AB  - Deep learning (DL) based hyperspectral images (HSIs) denoising approaches directly learn the nonlinear mapping between noisy and clean HSI pairs. They usually do not consider the physical characteristics of HSIs. This drawback makes the models lack interpretability that is key to understanding their denoising mechanism and limits their denoising ability. In this paper, we introduce a novel model-guided interpretable network for HSI denoising to tackle this problem. Fully considering the spatial redundancy, spectral low-rankness, and spectral-spatial correlations of HSIs, we first establish a subspace-based multidimensional sparse (SMDS) model under the umbrella of tensor notation. After that, the model is unfolded into an end-to-end network named SMDS-Net, whose fundamental modules are seamlessly connected with the denoising procedure and optimization of the SMDS model. This makes SMDS-Net convey clear physical meanings, i.e., learning the low-rankness and sparsity of HSIs. Finally, all key variables are obtained by discriminative training. Extensive experiments and comprehensive analysis on synthetic and real-world HSIs confirm the strong denoising ability, strong learning capability, promising generalization ability, and high interpretability of SMDS-Net against the state-of-the-art HSI denoising methods. The source code and data of this article will be made publicly available at https://github.com/bearshng/smds-net for reproducible research.

AB  - Long term continuous monitoring of electrocardiogram (ECG) in a free living environment provides valuable information for the prevention on the heart attack and other high risk diseases. Most of the existing devices provide ECG recording in a hospital setting or off-line ECG diagnosis. The design of a real-time wearable ECG monitoring device with cardiac arrhythmia classification system is discussed in this paper. In this system, the wearable sensor node monitors the patient's ECG and motion signal in an unobstructive way that the patient's daily life will not be affected. ECG analog front-end and on-node processing are designed to remove most of the noise and bias, which guarantees an clean and reliable ECG waveform. The ECG waveform is digitalized by an analog-to-digital convertor and transmitted to a smart phone via bluetooth. On the smartphone, the ECG waveform is visualized and a novel layered hidden Markov model is implemented to classify multiple cardiac arrhythmias in real time. This paper evaluates the performance of the hardware design and the classification algorithm.

AB  - Urban environments are characterised by the presence of distinctive audio signals which alert the drivers to events that require prompt action. The detection and interpretation of these signals would be highly beneficial for smart vehicle systems, as it would provide them with complementary information to navigate safely in the environment. In this paper, we present a framework that spots the presence of acoustic events, such as horns and sirens, using a two-stage approach. We first model the urban soundscape and use anomaly detection to identify the presence of an anomalous sound, and later determine the nature of this sound. As the audio samples are affected by copious non-stationary and unstructured noise, which can degrade classification performance, we propose a noise-removal technique to obtain a clean representation of the data we can use for classification and waveform reconstruction. The method is based on the idea of analysing the spectrograms of the incoming signals as images and applying spectrogram segmentation to isolate and extract the alerting signals from the background noise. We evaluate our framework on four hours of urban sounds collected driving around urban Oxford on different kinds of road and in different traffic conditions. When compared to traditional feature representations, such as Mel-frequency cepstrum coefficients, our framework shows an improvement of up to 31% in the classification rate.

AB  - Objective: Noise reduction algorithms in current hearing devices lack informationabout the sound source a user attends to when multiple sources are present. To resolve this issue, they can be complemented with auditory attention decoding (AAD) algorithms, which decode the attention using electroencephalography (EEG) sensors. State-of-the-art AAD algorithms employ a stimulus reconstruction approach, in which the envelope of the attended source is reconstructed from the EEG and correlated with the envelopes of the individual sources. This approach, however, performs poorly on short signal segments, whilelonger segments yield impractically long detection delays when the user switches attention. Methods: We propose decoding the directional focus of attention using filterbank common spatial pattern filters (FB-CSP) as an alternative AAD paradigm, whichdoes not require access to the clean source envelopes. Results: The proposed FB-CSP approach outperforms both the stimulus reconstruction approach on short signal segments, as well as a convolutional neural network approach on the same task. We achieve a high accuracy (80% for 1 s windows and 70% for quasi-instantaneous decisions), which is sufficient to reach minimal expected switch durations below 4 s. We also demonstrate that the decoder can adapt to unlabeled data from anunseen subject and works with only a subset of EEG channels located around the ear to emulate a wearable EEG setup. Conclusion: The proposed FB-CSP method provides fast and accurate decoding of the directional focus of auditory attention. Significance: The high accuracy on very short data segments is a major step forward towards practical neuro-steered hearing devices.

AB  - Complex propagation channels in indoor environments introduce considerable clutter and distortions to frontal radar images. Autoencoders, when provided with corrupted and corresponding clean images during training, can learn how to mitigate clutter in these images during testing. The main advantage is that an analytical framework of the channel is not required. On the other hand, the algorithm relies on the availability of a large database of correctly labelled training data - the target scenarios in cluttered environments must be exactly replicated in free space. We propose to augment the conventional denoising autoencoder with sparsity based multiple layer representations to handle the labelling mismatch errors. We hypothesize that the deeper representations with sparsity constraints will enable extraction of more fundamental features of the images. Our radar data consists of measurements made with a wideband RF imaging sensor called the Walabot. Our algorithm improves upon the conventional autoencoder in terms of performance with respect to signal to clutter and signal to noise ratios, labelling mismatch errors and computational time during testing.

AB  - HfC was evaluated as a cold field emission source. Single crystal HfC was produced and fabricated into cold field emitters, then angular intensity and reduced brightness were determined from experimental I(V) data. Energy distribution data were in agreement with a theoretical model. The reduced brightness, energy distribution, and emission stability are compared to commercially available sources which show that HfC produced a higher brightness and a lower energy spread than a W cold field source or a ZrO/W Schottky emitter. HfC maintains its emission level for one hour in moderate UHV condition; a dramatic improvement over the stability of W. This combined with a durability that allows for frequent flash cleaning without degradation of the emitter end form make HfC a highly promising source. We compared stability and noise to emission from a tungsten tip at the same angular intensity. By increasing the emitter temperature slightly, stability is improved while maintaining a low energy spread.

AB  - This paper presents a new and simple method to noninvasively localize failure sites in an insulated-gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) module by using a magnetic probe. The method detects the magnetic field generated by leakage currents occurring at the broken gates of an IGBT module. In this method, not only an RF stimulus signal but also a dc bias voltage is applied to the IGBT module under test, because the resistance of the failure site's change depends upon the dc bias condition. A high-sensitivity magnetic probe is used to detect the magnetic field to locate the corresponding fault positions. The magnetic probe is fully integrated onto a chip by a 180-nm CMOS process and includes a magnetic pickup coil, a low-noise amplifier, a downconversion mixer, and a low-pass filter. Magnetic scanning experiments are implemented for two kinds of IGBT module samples to demonstrate the detection of the broken gate positions. In addition, a visual confirmation of the broken gate positions is performed. Several postprocessing steps in a clean room are applied to these samples in order to visually confirm the scanning results of the proposed method. Experimental results successfully demonstrate that our method can be used for noninvasive localization of small intrinsic faults, on two kinds of SiC and Si substrates, of IGBT modules.

AB  - In recent years, the development of multi-sensor has emphasized the need to directly process multi-channel (multivariate) data. In this paper, a novel multivariate synchrosqueezing wavelet transform denoising method combined with subspace projection (SWT-SP) is proposed. One of the key points of this method is to obtain an optimal orthogonal matrix which can project a multivariate observation signal to a signal subspace occupied by a clean signal and an orthogonal noise subspace occupied by noise. Furthermore, the high dimensional time-frequency representation based on the synchrosqueezing transform realizes the multichannel signal information fusion, and the subspace projection makes full use of the spatial diversity characteristics of the observed signal. Finally, signal energy produces the aggregation effect in the former dimension space, which improves the signal-to-noise ratio(SNR) of signals in the signal subspace. The performance of this algorithm for standard multichannel denoising is verified on both real-world data and synthetic signals. The reconstructed signal obtained the improvement of the highest SNR by about 6 dB under different conditions.

AB  - Heart Rate is one of the fundamental parameters to judge the fitness of a human body. Over history, many techniques have been used like a stethoscope and some very crude ones like manually tapping the wrist. The aim of this paper is to propose an Optical Heart rate monitor and its implementation in smart health monitoring systems. A technique named Photoplethysmogram is explored. The advantage of this technique lies in its simplicity, low cost, small form factor and ease of implementation in a smart system. Although the design is simple it poses a challenge of perfect amplification and filtering out noise in order to get a smooth and accurate waveform. The paper discusses Analog Front-end design and noise reduction. Once clean data is obtained, its integration with multiple platforms like PC, smartphone is investigated thus pushing towards a smart health-care system.

AB  - The event camera is a novel sensor that records brightness change in the form of asynchronous events with high temporal resolution, and simultaneously outputs intensity images with a lower frame rate. Events recorded by sensors have a lot of noise and the intensity images captured often suffer from motion blur and noise effects. Therefore, to reconstruct high quality images is of great significance for the application of event camera in computer vision. However, the existing reconstruction methods only addressed the motion blur issue without considering the influence of noise. In this paper, we propose a variational model by using spatial smooth constraint regularization to recover clean image frames from blurry and noisy camera images and events at any frame rate. We present experimental results on synthetic dataset as well as real dataset with high speed and high dynamic range to demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is superior to the other reconstruction algorithms.

AB  - Fault diagnostics involving the Internet of Things (IoT) sensors and edge devices is a challenging task due to their limited energy and computational capabilities. Another challenge concerning IoT sensors or devices is the incursion of noise when used in an industrial environment. The noisy samples affect the decision support system that could lead to financial and operational losses. This paper proposes a Noisy Encoder using Artificial Intelligence of Things (NEAT) architecture for fault diagnosis in IoT edge devices. NEAT combines autoencoders and Inception module to co-train the clean and noisy samples for solving the said problem. Experimental results on benchmark datasets reveal that the NEAT architecture is noise resilient in comparison to the existing works. Furthermore, we also show that the NEAT architecture has lightweight characteristics as it yields a lower number of parameters, weight storage, training, and testing times that support its real-life applicability in an Industrial IoT environment.

AB  - The capacity to identify the contamination in surface electromyography (sEMG) signals is necessary for applying the sEMG controlled prosthesis over time. In this paper, the method for the automatic identification of commonly occurring contaminant types in sEMG signals is evaluated. The presented approach uses two-class support vector machine (SVM) trained with clean sEMG and artificially contaminated sEMG. The contaminants considered include electrocardiogram interference, motion artefact, power line interference, amplifier saturation, and electrode displacement. The results demonstrated that the sEMG signal with the contaminants could readily be distinguished, even with increase channels degraded. The SFTD detection depends on the noise type, whether the amputee or non-amputee subjects and which channel is being analysed. This method presented a suitable solution for the detection of contaminants in the sEMG signal, being able to provide the acquired signal validation before the movement intended recognition to operate in an intelligent recognition with greater reliability.

AB  - Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of progressive vision loss in the elderly. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a promising diagnostic tool for early detection and management of AMD. However, the speckle noise and low resolution (LR) of the OCT images affect its diagnostic viabilities. Therefore, denoising and super-resolution (SR) techniques present a potential solution to improve the quality of the OCT images. Recent methods rely on example-based approaches that require paired LR and high resolution (HR) images for training. However, the large scale acquisition of paired LR-HR images presents pertinent challenges in clinical settings. Therefore, this work proposes an unsupervised framework using the generative adversarial network (GAN) to perform fast and reliable SR without the requirement of aligned LR-HR pairs. We use adversarial learning with cycle consistency and identity mapping priors to preserve the spatial correlation, color and texture details in the generated clean HR images. Experimental results on clinical-grade OCT images show that the proposed method outperforms the existing methods both in terms of SR performance and computational time. Improved classification accuracy of 96.54% is obtained when the generated images are used for automated AMD diagnosis. The enhanced generalizability and faithful reconstruction attributes make the proposed method suitable for assisting ophthalmologists in better diagnosis and treatment planning.

AB  - The non-intrusive human activity recognition has been envisioned as a key enabler for many emerging applications requiring interactions between humans and computing systems. To accurately recognize different human behaviors, ubiquitous wireless signals are widely adopted, e.g., Wi-Fi signals, whose Channel State Information can precisely reflect human movements. Unfortunately, nearly all Wi-Fi-based recognition systems assume a clean wireless environment, i.e., no interference will compromise the developed algorithms, which, apparently, is not feasible in practice. Even worse, for systems using Wi-Fi 2.4GHz signals, the widely existing interference from coexisting protocols, such as ZigBee, Bluetooth, and LTE-Unlicensed, can easily compromise the recognition process, posing a hard limit on further enhancing the accuracy. Therefore, this work uncovers a new wireless adversarial attack against Wi-Fi-based human activity recognition systems, by intentionally injecting interference using coexisting protocol signals. The contaminated Wi-Fi signal will distort CSI estimation and finally output a false recognition result. Different from traditional jamming attacks, this new adversarial attack is intelligent and stealthy in terms of avoiding being detected from traffic analysis. Along with both theoretical analysis and extensive real-world experiments, we have shown this newly-identified attack can easily compromise many existing Wi-Fi-based human recognition systems while still bypassing malicious signal detection schemes.

AB  - Wearable technologies have made ubiquitous, non-invasive continuous monitoring of vital signs outside of the clinical setting possible. Convenient and user friendly embedded sensors in wearable technologies such as wristbands or watch, unlike cumbersome electrocardiogram Holter monitors, have made long term monitoring possible in normal home/home-care setting. However, such vital sign monitors are highly susceptible to motion artifacts and hence the quality of signal suffers. In order to develop a reliable automated technique to estimate vital signs, it is necessary to understand and estimate the quality of the acquired signal. In this paper, we compare the characteristics of signal corrupted by motion artifact against the artifact-free photoplethysmographic (PPG) signal acquired from an Empatica E4 wristband over 24 hours from 15 participants as the first step toward understanding and quantifying the quality of PPG signals. Using four 10 second segments of artifact-free and clean PPG signal from each participant, features that describe the signal are extracted. Bhattacharyya distance measure is used to rank the features that represent quality of the PPG signal. Using set of highly ranked features, a Naïve Bayes classifier is designed to quantify the quality of the PPG signal.

AB  - In this study, we propose a novel procedure "RepMA" based on image processing of recurrence plots to detect motion artifacts (MA) in PPG signals. The idea is by using recurrence plots we convert the signal into a binary image that can be processed later for distortion and corruption. The algorithm runs on each 4 sec segments of the signal and the recurrence plot (image) of each segment is then preprocessed and analyzed to determine if the segment is clean or corrupted by noise. The MAs change the signal recurrence behavior and their irregular recurrence patterns that can be utilized to distinguish between clean and corrupted PPG segment. We used the lab controlled PPG recordings from forehead and finger pulse oximeter sensors with random movements for evaluating of RepMA performance. The results of RepMA algorithm were compared to two different algorithms known for their alleged competency in MA detection: the Hjorth and Shannon entropy. The proposed detection method outperforms the two other methods in terms of accuracy, run-time, specificity and sensitivity. Moreover, our algorithm is able to be implemented in real-time.

AB  - The accelerated move toward the adoption of the Industrial Internet-of-Things (IIoT) paradigm has resulted in numerous shortcomings as far as security is concerned. One of the IIoT affecting critical security threats is what is termed as the false data injection (FDI) attack. The FDI attacks aim to mislead the industrial platforms by falsifying their sensor measurements. FDI attacks have successfully overcome the classical threat detection approaches. In this article, we present a novel method of FDI attack detection using autoencoders (AEs). We exploit the sensor data correlation in time and space, which in turn can help identify the falsified data. Moreover, the falsified data are cleaned using the denoising AEs (DAEs). Performance evaluation proves the success of our technique in detecting FDI attacks. It also significantly outperforms a support vector machine (SVM)-based approach used for the same purpose. The DAE data cleaning algorithm is also shown to be very effective in recovering clean data from corrupted (attacked) data.

AB  - Unresolved scatterers (separated by less than a 3-dB matched filter main lobe width) are known to degrade the matching pursuit performances in radar: It tends to generate spurious detection or miss weaker targets, hidden in strong sidelobes. In this paper, we propose a new matching pursuit algorithm performing a subspace radar resolution cell rejection. The philosophy is the following: As it is usually not possible to distinguish several unresolved scatterers, we do not try to distinguish them, but when a scatterer is detected, then every contribution in the corresponding resolution cell should be cleaned. For that, the continuous cell interval is approximated by a subspace and the corresponding orthogonal projector is build. The projector basis is chosen so that it minimizes the projection residue inside the interval and a method is proposed to select its dimension according to the rejected target SNR. We show that it enables to control the sidelobe level after rejection (orthogonal projection) so that the sidelobe detection probability can be maintained low. It allows matching pursuit to work well even if the target parameter distribution differs from a delta Dirac distribution inside the matched filter resolution cell.

AB  - This paper proposes a new fetal monitoring system, including the acquisition and the processing of fetal heart sounds (FHS). Based on the foundation of the stethoscope principle, a single-channel, non-invasive sensor is designed to acquire the fetal heart sounds, in which polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane material is used as the core transducer. In the fetal heart sounds processing part, we propose a new method for denoising based on adaptive support vector regression (SVR) which has a good performance on curve fitting and effectively weakens the interference of additive noise. Thus, the clean fetal heart signals extracted from the interfered source can be further utilized to draw the fetal phonocardiogram (FPCG) and calculate the fetal heart rate (FHR).

AB  - Depth sensors have become increasingly popular in interactive computer vision applications. Currently, most of these applications are limited to indoor use. Popular IR-based depth sensors cannot provide depth data when exposed to sunlight. In these cases, one can still obtain depth information using a stereo camera set up or a special outdoor Time-of-Flight camera, at the cost of a reduced quality of the depth image. The resulting depth images are often incomplete and suffer from low resolution, noise and missing information. The aim of this paper is to recover the missing depth information based on an extension of SEEDS superpixels [11]. The superpixel segmentation algorithm is extended to take depth information into account where available. The approach takes advantage of the boundary-updating property of SEEDS. The result is a clean segmentation that recovers the missing depth information in a low-quality depth image. We test the approach outdoors on an interactive urban robot. The system is used to segment a person in front of the robot, and to detect body parts for interaction with the robot using pointing gestures.

Exploiting such input to gain awareness of an incident is a critical direction for research in effective emergency management. In this paper we present an overview of the SMART-C system, which is part of the social media initiative at the Department of Homeland Security. The system aims to enable robust bidirectional communication between emergency management and the public at large throughout the disaster life-cycle via a multitude of devices and modalities including cell phones, MMS messages, text messages, blogs, Twitter, etc. A discussion of the major components of SMART-C and related research challenges is included. These components include mechanisms to model event level semantic information, a platform for implementing multi-sensor fusion, mechanisms for estimating the veracity of information, data cleaning to reduce uncertainty and enhance accuracy of event detection and notification, and spatiotemporal analyses for pattern and trend analyses for higher level observations.

AB  - Presently ECG signal telemonitoring is one of the essential branch in telemedicine system. So it is highly desirable to construct a robust telemonitoring system through wireless body area network (WBAN) with consumption of less energy and less power. A number of traditional ECG reconstruction techniques have been proposed to recover the clean ECG data. However because of some specific behavior and characteristics of raw ECG data like non sparsity and heavy contamination of noise the traditional methods do not succeed in this application. This paper proposes an effective reconstruction method followed by Independent Component Analysis (ICA) in an intention to obtain the clean ECG data. The proposed framework includes context based learning adopted reconstruction method. Experimental results along with simulation results show that this framework is able to reconstruct the raw ECG recordings with high accuracy and high quality. Context based learning learns the existing context in the signal and reacts to changing context, which uses k-means clustering via singular value decomposition i.e. KSVD algorithm to recover raw ECG signal. In this paper, the proposed method shows better reconstruction performance than the traditional compressed sensing method retaining the sparsity of the ECG signal intact.

The signal processing method and processing flow that enable through-wall target detection are introduced. The high-speed noise and interference mitigation methods implemented in the system for through-wall target detection are also described. A series of experimental results are presented for both large and small human body movements in through-wall scenarios. It is shown that the high-resolution Doppler event history implemented in the system enables the system to recognize and distinguish a range of body movements. The results demonstrate that this real-time SDR-based wireless detection system is a low-cost solution for human movement and recognition, with a range of applications.

AB  - In this paper, we introduce a new method for removing noise from digital images, based on statistical model of wavelet coefficients. We use two-dimensional generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) model for statistical modeling of wavelet coefficients. Using two-dimensional GARCH model yields a novel wavelet coefficients model, which is capable of taking into account important characteristics of wavelet coefficients, such as non-stationarity, heavy tailed marginal distribution, and the dependencies between the coefficients. We use minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimator for estimating the clean wavelet image coefficients. Here, to prove the performance of this method in image denoising, we have compared our proposed method with various image denoising methods.

AB  - Clean images are an important requirement for machine vision systems to recognize visual features correctly. However, the environment, optics, electronics of the physical imaging systems can introduce extreme distortions and noise in the acquired images. In this work, we explore the use of reservoir computing, a dynamical neural network model inspired from biological systems, in creating dynamic image filtering systems that extracts signal from noise using inverse modeling. We discuss the possibility of implementing these networks in hardware close to the sensors.

AB  - Basic service robot technologies become more and more mature so that applications far beyond fetch and carry tasks will be possible in near future. Using a multifunctional service robot as a cleaning assistant is one interesting and challenging application. To be of any use, cleaning robots have to be able to verify the results of their work or have to find dirt in the beginning for point-wise cleaning. This paper presents an approach towards the detection of various dirt on textured surfaces using a low-cost RGB-D sensor. The algorithm aims at removing the regular part of the image with spectral residual filtering leaving only the dirt and some noise. With further post-processing it is possible to localize many kinds of dirt in the image. The proposed method is fast, reliable, quite robust to illumination changes and does not require any prior training of the surfaces to inspect.

AB  - Motion artifacts (MA) are potent sources of noise in wearable photoplethysmography (PPG) signals and can impact the estimation of heart rate (HR) of an individual. In this paper, a method using adaptive neural network filters (ANNF) is proposed for accurate estimation of HR using dual channel PPG signals and simultaneous, three - dimensional acceleration signals. The MA cancellation method using ANNF, utilizes acceleration data as input signal. The PPG signals serve as a target, while the error is the clean PPG signal. The proposed method also includes a post-processing smoothing and median filter which improves the HR estimation. The reason for this approach is that the acceleration signal in wearables are only within 3% of the ground truth value. Experimental results on datasets recorded from 12 subjects, publicly available, showed that the proposed algorithm achieves an absolute error of 1.15 beats per minute (BPM). The results also confirm that the proposed method is highly resilient to motion artifacts and maintains high accuracy for PPG estimation and compares favorably against other methods.

AB  - Smart homes aim at enhancing the quality of life of people at home by the use of home automation systems and Ambient Intelligence. Most of these smart homes provide enhanced interaction by relying on context-aware systems learned on data. Whereas voice-based interaction is the current emerging trend, most available corpora are either concerned only with home automation sensors or only with audio technology, which limits the development of context-aware voice-based systems. This paper presents the VocADom@A4H corpus, which is a dataset composed of users' interactions recorded in a fully equipped Smart Home. About 12 hours of multichannel distant speech signal synchronized with logs of an openHAB home automation system were collected from 11 participants who performed activities of daily living with the presence of real-life noises, such as other persons speaking, use of vacuum cleaner, TV, etc. This corpus can serve as a valuable material for studies in pervasive intelligence, such as human tracking, human activity recognition, context aware interaction, and robust distant speech processing in the home. Experiments performed on multichannel speech and home automation sensors data for robust voice activity detection and multiresident localization show the potential of the corpus to support the development of context-aware smart home systems.

AB  - Heart rate variability (HRV) measures the instantaneous change in heart rate and is an important marker for checking physical condition as well as mental stress of a person. In this paper, we propose a methodology to calculate HRV of a person using smart phone audio. Heart sound is captured in the inbuilt microphone of a smart phone, by placing the device on the chest of the person. We propose a process flow to make the phone captured noisy audio signal clean and audible. Furthermore, we propose a novel peak detection algorithm for accurately locating the peaks corresponding to heart sound in the noisy audio signal. The algorithm is also capable of rejecting the noisy peaks present in the captured audio that resembles heart sound pattern. Results show that the proposed methodology yields significant improvement in estimating HRV parameters compared to a clinical pulse-oximeter device, that works on the principle of photoplethysmogram (PPG) technique.

AB  - Clean data are essential for any kind of alarm or control system. To achieve the required level of data quality in online water quality monitoring, a system for fault tolerant control was developed. A modular approach was used, in which a sensor and station management module is combined with a data validation and an event detection module. The station management module assures that all relevant data, including operational data, is available and the state of the monitoring devices is fully documented. The data validation module assures that unreliable data is detected, marked as such, and that the need for sensor maintenance is timely indicated. Finally, the event detection module marks unusual system states and triggers measures and notifications. All these modules were combined into a new software package to be used on water quality monitoring stations.

AB  - Driven by a wide range of real-world applications, several ground-breaking RF-based motion-recognition systems were proposed to detect and/or recognize macro/micro human movements. These systems often suffer from various interferences caused by multiple-users moving simultaneously, resulting in extremely low recognition accuracy. Even if the repetitive motions are fairly well detectable through the wireless signals in theory, in reality they get blended into various other system noises during the motion. Moreover, irregular motion patterns among users will lead to expensive computation cost for motion recognition. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel wireless sensing system, called Motion-Fi$\ ^+$+, which marries battery-free wireless backscattering and device-free sensing in one clean sheet. Motion-Fi$\ ^+$+ is an accurate, interference tolerable motion-recognition system, which counts repetitive motions without using scenario-dependent templates or profiles and enables multi-user performing certain motions simultaneously because of the relatively short transmission range of backscattered signals and dedicated signal separation method. We implement a backscattering wireless platform to validate our design in various scenarios for over 6 months when different persons, distances and orientations are incorporated. In our experiments, the periodicity in motions could be recognized without any learning or training process, and the accuracy of counting such motions can be achieved within 5 percent count error. With little efforts in learning the patterns, our method could achieve 95.2 percent motion-recognition accuracy for a variety of 7 typical motions. Moreover, by leveraging the periodicity of motions, the recognition accuracy could be further improved to nearly 100 percent with only three repetitions. Our experiments also show that the motions of multiple persons separating by around $ 2$ meters cause little accuracy reduction in the counting process.

AB  - Bio-signal processing performance heavily dependent on the quality of the signal. Noise removal from input signal is the primary task of this process at initial stages. This is main requirement of healthcare technology deployment for clinical usage to wearable devices with optimum power consumption and robust methods. Due to insufficient information on cleaned real-world data, performance evaluation of noise removal methods for real-world signals is currently problematic. With the advancement in sensor technology, data storage and interface technology, it provides the reliable collection of data for medical purpose. Noises generated from devices functioning, body’s internal functioning and surrounding environment of patient degrades the signal quality. With the advancement in signal processing domain significant improvement in noise removal has been achieved in recent years. Most techniques are based on the mathematical models which resembles suitably to the signal’s nature. This paper reviews the noise removal techniques used in previous works.

The method generates a set of DEM tiles in a common coordinate system from multiple overlapping images, and then employs the concept of self-consistency to detect and remove errors from the tiles. The clean tiles are averaged together to form a low noise composite DEM. The method is tested on real and photo realistic simulated data. Results show that the method is capable of producing a virtually error free composite DEM.

AB  - We describe the key parts of our recent work to develop a planar thin-film DC SQUID with a closely-coupled spiral input coil. Our aim has been to make a device that is superior to present RF SQUID sensors in terms of sensitivity and long-term reliability. To be compatible with an RF SQUID the inductance of the input coils must be relatively large, typically 2 μH, and the input noise current in the white noise region should be below 10pA Hz-1/2. A low level of 1/f noise is also necessary for many applications and should be achieved without the use of complex noise-cancelling circuitry. Our devices meet these criteria. We include a description of work on window and edge junction fabrication using ion beam cleaning, thermal oxidation and RF plasma processing.

AB  - Visual information can improve the performance of automatic speech recognition (ASR), especially in the presence of background noise or different speech modes. A key problem is how to fuse the acoustic and visual features leveraging their complementary information and overcoming the alignment differences between modalities. Current audiovisual ASR (AV-ASR) systems rely on linear interpolation or extrapolation as a pre-processing technique to align audio and visual features, assuming that the feature sequences are aligned frame-by-frame. These pre-processing methods oversimplify the phase difference between lip motion and speech, lacking flexibility and impairing the performance of the system. This paper addresses the fusion of audiovisual features with an alignment neural network (AliNN), relying on recurrent neural network (RNN) with attention model. The proposed front-end model can automatically learn the alignment from the data. The resulting aligned features are concatenated and fed to conventional back-end ASR systems. The proposed front-end system is evaluated with matched and mismatch channel conditions, under clean and noisy recordings. The results show that our proposed approach can relatively outperform the baseline by 24.9% with Gaussian mixture model with hidden Markov model (GMM-HMM) back-end and 2.4% with deep neural network with hidden Markov model (DNN-HMM) back-end.

AB  - Target detection technique in hyperspectral imagery has been widely applied in various applications. However, its performance is severely limited by the useless interference contained in hyperspectral images (HSIs), mainly caused by the atmosphere, illumination, issues within the sensor itself, and some other factors. In this paper, we propose a hyperspectral target detector based on linear mixture model (LMM), which consists of three components. First, a hierarchical denoising autoencoder (HDAE) is specifically designed for redundant interference removal; then we apply an adaptive cluster approach to extract several representative background samples from the clean HSI; lastly, a target detector with subspace projection is developed for background suppression and target enhancement based on the clean HSI, representative background and prior-known target signatures. Experimental results on two real-world HSIs show the superiority of our proposed method, namely, the HDASP detector, comparing with other state-of-the-art target detection methods.

AB  - Benefited from the rapid and sustainable development of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors, change detection from SAR images has received increasing attentions over the past few years. Existing unsupervised deep learning-based methods have made great efforts to exploit robust feature representations, but they consume much time to optimize parameters. Besides, these methods use clustering to obtain pseudolabels for training, and the pseudolabeled samples often involve errors, which can be considered as “label noise.” To address these issues, we propose a dual path denoising network (DPDNet) for SAR image change detection. In particular, we introduce the random label propagation to clean the label noise involved in preclassification. We also propose the distinctive patch convolution for feature representation learning to reduce the time consumption. Specifically, the attention mechanism is used to select distinctive pixels in the feature maps, and patches around these pixels are selected as convolution kernels. Consequently, the DPDNet does not require a great number of training samples for parameter optimization, and its computational efficiency is greatly enhanced. Extensive experiments have been conducted on five SAR datasets to verify the proposed DPDNet. The experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms several state-of-the-art methods in change detection results.

AB  - Compared to well-established underwater acoustic communication techniques, underwater wireless optical communication (UWOC) offers significantly more transmission bandwidth and can be used in multiple short-range marine applications. Color-shift keying (CSK) is a modulation techniques advocated for deploying high data rate transmission in red, green and blue (RGB) based laser technology. It utilizes light sources that produce Lambertian light patterns. Consequently, the broadcast message arrives at the receiver via line-of-sight (LoS) pathways, with the Rician distribution being used to model the appropriate channel. This paper analyzes UWOC visible light communication (VLC) links using light emitting diodes (LDs) as transmitter with small angular divergence. The channel direct current (DC) gains is considered in the analysis to show the channel gain, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), channel capacitance, and outage probability. This study also looks at the outage probability or the locally observed SNR of the CSK link below the threshold set for a particular quality of services. The results are depicted for a random white light in an UWOC system clean ocean. They shows that the SNR of the RGB Based Laser UWOC is proportional to $P_{t}/N_{0}$. The results also shows that the channel capacity increases with $P_{t}/N_{0}$ depending on the attenuation intensity $\beta$. Finally, as the data rate increases with a fixed $P_{t}/N_{0}$, the outage probability increases. The data rate increases with $P_{t}/N_{0}$ and the transmission power with a fixed value outage probability.

Due to disturbed variances by illumination, equipment and environment, the collected data is frequently smeared by noises. Although there have been outlier-against works proposed, most of them suffer from redundant parameters. Even worse, few of them have modeled the cross-view complementary information. Actually, in multi-view learning, not only the clean data points, but also those outliers share the same prototypes in common space, by contrast, the margin value of the latter is non-zero. Motivated by this, in this article, we construct a robust multi-view prototype (RMVP) learning model with auxiliary margin matrices. Specifically, in RMVP, the projection matrices corresponding to each view span the common space to characterize the prototypes, simultaneously. In addition, an auxiliary sparse margin matrix for corresponding view identifies the distance gaps of outliers, whose non-zero column vector represents the margin value. To improve the robustness, the lasso regularization is penalized on the auxiliary matrices. And, an alternating optimization algorithm is presented to solve the proposed model. Finally, extensive experiments are constructed to testify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB  - Pulse oximeter employed in intensive care units and is a crucial equipment employed to measure the vital parameters like heart rate and blood oxygen saturation levels. Using Pulse oximeter, photoplethysmographic (PPG) data is recorded using the PPG sensors attached to the patient is used to estimate oxygen saturation levels. Patient movements while recording the PPG data may result in erroneous estimation of required parameters may result in wrong diagnosis by the clinician. For exact estimation of arterial blood oxygen saturation (SpO2), a clean motion artifacts (MA) reduced is required. MA can be detached from the recorded PPG data using a classical filters, but the in-band noise components cannot be eliminated. In this work, we present a simple technique, multi-scale independent component analysis (MsICA), to reduce MA component present in PPG data. The authors proposed the technique by considering its advantages of MSICA when applied to quasi stationary signals. The superiority of proposed method has been proved by comparing the experimental results with results obtained using Independent component analysis (ICA) method. PPG data recorded with different MA (vertical, horizontal and bending movements of patient's finger) is considered for experiment analysis. Obtained SpO2 parameter computed values proved the effectiveness of the technique in measurement of accurate SpO2, helpful for effective medical diagnosis.

AB  - Power inverters are widely installed to feed the electrical energy from the distributed generation stations into the existing electrical grid. The IGBT-based inverters control the IGBTs, one type of the power semiconducting switches, to form the matched end voltage for the successful power injection. However, the rapid switching with large conducting current of IGBTs results in a large amount of high frequency spikes in the sensor measurement. The presence of the IGBT switching spikes causes the poor operating performance of the inverters and the false detection of the abnormal operating conditions. The present work is devoted to research and development of a new IGBT switching spike identification method to further clean these spikes and preserve any other signal shapes.

AB  - Solar energy is a clean, renewable and sustainable energy source that has the potential of becoming one of the major constituents of the total global energy mix. The achievement of maximum possible photovoltaic (PV) energy conversion requires that the sun's direct beam directly illuminates the photovoltaic panel's surface as long as possible. This can possibly be achieved through solar tracking techniques. Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) based tracking systems face multiple predicaments such as temporary clouding, fog, man-made blockage and others that cause impaired tracking. The objective of this research is to develop an LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) based solar tracker that has the ability to make accurate decisions and ignore faulty sensor readings. To satisfy this objective, Machine Learning techniques are implemented to produce a tracker that has the ability to learn and improve its action from daily interaction with the environment. A Machine Learning based algorithm is developed and implemented in a MATLAB environment. The algorithm has the functionality of continuously testing the consistency of input LDR sensor values, hence making the decision of either approval of the values and usage for further learning or alternatively, discarding of the values and replacing it by a more logical value from the previously learned information. The developed system is tested using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). The system has showed a lowered and converging error response in varying environmental conditions (Sunny, Semi-Cloudy and Cloudy), thus the proposed system has proved its effectiveness in tackling the temporary blockage problem, resulting in a cheap, robust and noise tolerant solar tracking system.

AB  - Pulse signal is prone to corruption with motion artifacts (MA) due to attachment of the sensor to extreme body parts like finger, toes and forehead. This paper compares the performance between two popular statistical signal processing tools, viz., principal component analysis (PCA) with fast independent component analysis (/ICA) in reduction of MA from finger pulse signal collected from 30 human volunteers. A multivariate dataset was generated with systolic peak-aligned Photoplethysmogram (PPG) beats extracted from time series data. After eigenvalues decomposition of the covariance matrix, the original data was reconstructed using the first principal component. The mean correlation coefficient of average beat template of ICA preprocessed data and clean data, averaged over 30 volunteers is 0.9876 while that of PCA preprocessed data with clean data is 0.9778. With white Gaussian noise of known SNR, maximum absolute error for PCA preprocessed data is very small, 3.14% from SNR 25dB onwards. It was also found that beat to beat correlation is higher in the PCA preprocessed data.

AB  - Motion artifact (MA) contamination with electrocardiogram (ECG) signal is a common issue caused by body movement or sensor loosening, resulting in distortion of clinical features of ECG. In this work, the Monte Carlo filter (MCF)-based MA removal from single-channel ECG signal is proposed, assisting in real-time telecardiology systems. Initially, after R-peak detection and beat extraction, principal component (PC) analysis was performed upon clean ECG beats, and PC, with the highest energy, was assumed to be the feature beat. Using this feature beat, MA corrupted beats were denoised successively to achieve a clean pattern of ECG using MCF. A new approach of weight calculation and resampling was also proposed for better performance of the MCF. Performance of the proposed algorithm was tested on the IEEE Signal Processing Cup Challenge 2015 ECG database and MIT-BIH arrythmia records, with an improvement of signal-to-noise ratio between 10 and 15 dB, after MA removal. The proposed work was also tested on real-time ECG data collected from ten healthy volunteers using the AD8232 ECG module and Raspberry Pi, resulting in correlation coefficient higher than 0.99, between the original and denoised signals. The proposed algorithm was able to remove MA from any single-channel MA corrupted ECG signal, irrespective of lead category, using features of clean beats. A comparative study of the obtained result with previously published works ensured the superior performance on MA removal from ECG in the proposed work, along with real-time data collection, processing, and transmission.

AB  - To enhance the performance of the inertial navigation system (INS)/global position system (GPS) integrated navigation system for the land vehicle during GPS outages is an extremely challenging task. Though existing researches have made reasonable progress in positioning accuracy, they largely ignore sophisticated vehicle stopping events, and the further improvement of positioning performance is urgently needed in complex urban environments. In this article, we propose a heterogeneous multi-task learning (MTL) structure with a shared de-noising process to conduct pseudo-GPS position prediction and zero-velocity detection. The raised model builds upon three vital parts: 1) a shared de-noising convolutional autoencoder (CAE), which can effectively filter the measurement noises in the original inputs and provide more clean data for subsequent calculations without the ground-truth sensor data; 2) a predictor that uses a deep temporal convolutional network (TCN) to predict pseudo-GPS position to bridge GPS gaps; and 3) a robust zero-velocity detector that utilizes a 1-D deep convolutional neural network to accurately detect the vehicle stationary pattern, allowing for timely correcting the velocity and heading. Our proposed MTL model is evaluated on extensive practical road data and achieves a root mean square error of 3.794 m for 120-s GPS outages under long-term vehicle stopping scenarios, which obviously outperforms the stand-alone long short-term memory, TCN, and TCN + CAE. Experimental results also demonstrate that our proposed MTL method yields a remarkable accuracy of over 99.0% for vehicle stationary detection.

AB  - Multi-channel speech enhancement with ad-hoc sensors has been a challenging task. Speech model guided beamforming algorithms are able to recover natural sounding speech, but the speech models tend to be oversimplified or the inference would otherwise be too complicated. On the other hand, deep learning based enhancement approaches are able to learn complicated speech distributions and perform efficient inference, but they are unable to deal with variable number of input channels. Also, deep learning approaches introduce a lot of errors, particularly in the presence of unseen noise types and settings. We have therefore proposed an enhancement framework called DEEPBEAM, which combines the two complementary classes of algorithms. DEEPBEAM introduces a beamforming filter to produce natural sounding speech, but the filter coefficients are determined with the help of a monaural speech enhancement neural network. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data show that Deepbeam is able to produce clean, dry and natural sounding speech, and is robust against unseen noise.

AB  - A low power brushless DC (BLDC) motor drive for domestic flour mill is manifested here. A soft starting based motion sensorless speed control algorithm for BLDC motor fed flour mill is implemented here as the large speed variation is the key challenge for a flour mill application. The implemented sensorless control is tolerant enough to control the current variation in position sensorless mode due to intermittent load variation of the flour mill. The sensorless control used here is insensitive to the switching noise and separate filtration for this not needed. Good rotor position estimation is achieved in wide speed range using the implemented sensorless control. A single DC link current sensor is used for the current control in sensorless starting and load variation. A boost converter based power factor correction is implemented her for maintaining the grid side power quality. The developed sensolress control algorithm is the motor model independent and no parameter estimation is required. The stability and reliability of this system is validated using both simulation and experimental test results.

AB  - Protecting person's face photos from being misused has been an important issue as the rapid development of ubiquitous face sensors. MeshFaces provide a simple and inexpensive way to protect facial photos and have been widely used in China. This paper treats MeshFace generation and removal as a dual learning problem and proposes a high-order relation-preserving CycleGAN framework to solve this problem. First, dual transformations between the distributions of MeshFaces and clean faces in pixel space are learned under the CycleGAN framework, which can efficiently utilize unpaired data. Then, a novel High-order Relation-preserving (HR) loss is imposed on CycleGAN to recover the finer texture details and generate much sharper images. Different from the L1 and L2 losses that result in image smoothness and blurry, the HR loss can better capture the appearance variation of MeshFaces and hence facilitates removal. Moreover, Identity Preserving loss is proposed to preserve both global and local identity information. Experimental results on three databases demonstrate that our approach is highly effective for MeshFace generation and removal.

It is particularly important to effectively classify and identify the disturbance signals in the power grid. This paper presents a recognition method based on energy difference and support vector machine. The method extracts signal feature vectors by calculating the energy difference of power grid signals and sends them to support vector machine for classification. Experiments were carried out on the power grid signals with and without noise. Experiments show that this method can effectively classify and recognize the disturbance signals, and the recognition rate is greatly improved. The effectiveness of the method is proved. This paper provides a theoretical basis for the improvement of power grid quality and intelligent monitoring management in the future.

AB  - Recent years have witnessed researchers paying enormous attention to design efficient multi-modal biometric systems because of their ability to withstand spoof attacks. Single biometric sometimes fails to extract adequate information for verifying the identity of a person [7]. On the other hand, by combining multiple modalities, enhanced performance reliability could be achieved. In this paper, we have fused face and palmprint modalities at all levels of fusion viz sensor level, feature level, decision level and score level. For this purpose, we have selected modality specific feature extraction algorithms for face and palmprint such as LDA and LPQ respectively. Popular databases AR (for face) and PolyU (for Palmprint) were considered for evaluation purposes. Rigorous experiments were conducted both under clean and noisy conditions to ascertain robust level of fusion and impact of fusion strategies at various levels of fusion for these two modalities. Results are substantiated with appropriate analysis.

AB  - T-Wave alternans (TWA) is a cardiac phenomenon regarded as an index of high risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD). Although a number of methods have been proposed for TWA detection, their final decision always fully depends on one single lead which is usually picked out for its strongest TWA detection result among all the other leads. That is to say that lots of useful information have been unused and wasted. To our best knowledge, no method that fuses TWA detection results independently obtained by each lead to do comprehensive decision has been introduced. In this paper, a novel multi-lead method for TWA fusion detection is proposed. This method combines Dezert-Smarandache theory (DSmT) with Laplacian likelihood ratio method (LLR) to gain higher detection rate. The proposed method was evaluated and compared with standard LLR method by means of a simulation study, in which extracted TWA waveform and clean background ECG from real records were used to synthetize simulated data with different types of simulated or physiological noises. These methods were also applied to real records from PTB Diagnostic ECG Database. The results are presented by constructing receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curves. All test results show that the proposed method has a larger margin of separability and higher detection rate than traditional methods. A more accurate and robust TWA detection method has great value to predict the risk of sudden cardiac death(SCD).

AB  - This paper focuses on the stability control algorithm for four-wheel independent steering (4WIS) and four-wheel independent drive (4WID) electric vehicle (EV) with the coordinated control of four-wheel steering (4WS) and direct yaw-moment control (DYC) techniques. In order to design an adaptive gain-scheduled robust controller for stability control, linear parameter-varying (LPV) system and H∞ optimal control theory are applied. The polytopic model is proposed to build the LPV system for 4WIS-4WID EV. Taking structured uncertainties and sensor noise into consideration, gain-scheduled robust controller is designed and worked out using linear matrix inequality (LMI). To verify the performance of the adaptive gain-scheduled robust controller, fishhook maneuver and sinusoidal steering maneuver are carried out based on hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) tests. Test results indicate that the adaptive gain-scheduled robust controller can improve vehicle's handling stability especially in extreme conditions. Meanwhile, the designed controller shows strong robustness to suppress system parametric perturbation.

AB  - Probabilistic queries have been extensively explored to provide answers with confidence, in order to support the real-life applications struggling with uncertain data, such as sensor networks and data integration. However, the uncertainty of data may propagate, and thus, the results returned by probabilistic queries contain much noise, which degrades query quality significantly. In this paper, we propose an efficient optimization framework, termed as QueryClean, for both probabilistic skyline computation and probabilistic similarity search. The goal of QueryClean is to optimize query quality via selecting a group of uncertain objects to clean under limited resource available, where a joint-entropy based quality function is leveraged. We develop an efficient structure called ASI to index the possible result sets of probabilistic queries, which helps to avoid many types of probabilistic query evaluations over a large number of the possible worlds for quality computation. Moreover, we present exact and approximate algorithms for the optimization problem, using two newly presented heuristics. Considerable experimental results on both real and synthetic data sets demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of our proposed framework QueryClean.

AB  - Most pulse oximeters determine blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) after calculating a coefficient, R, that represents the normalized ratiometric contributions of the pulsatile red and near-infrared photoplethysmograms (PPGs) acquired by the sensor. This paper presents a new approach that uses principle component analysis (PCA) to separate the signal and noise components of unfiltered PPGs and provide the determination of R. Also, rather than use peak-to-valley time intervals to obtain R, this technique uses eigenvalue and eigenvector data obtained during PCA to optimize these time intervals and improve the R calculation. Early analyses on unfiltered PPGs from 16 subjects indicate that these R values compare to those obtained from FFT-based methods and yield SpO2 values consistent with those reported by a commercial unit. All signal data are considered during the PCA process, so this technique shows promise to precisely segment clean versus noise-corrupted PPGs.

AB  - A versatile three-terminal test cell is described that permits accurate determination of the relative permittivity and loss factor of liquids. The cell takes a small charge, complies with IEC publication 247, and is particularly easy to dismantle, clean, and use. it is simple to set up because its housing fits directly into the opening in a commercial oil bath. Electrode and sample temperatures are accurately monitored with thermocouples and a platinum resistance thermometer, none of which introduces electrical noise into the measuring system. With direct injection, relative permittivity measurements can be made to within +or-0.00006%, this being twice the uncertainty in the air capacitance of the cell. The cell and its contents can be heated at a variety of rates, which makes it ideal for studying temperature-dependent loss in insulating liquids. Experimental results on a silicon fluid and high-voltage cable oil are included.<>

AB  - This paper presents a dual-stage approach to nanopositioning in which the tradeoff between the scanner speed and range is addressed by combining a slow, large-range scanner with a short-range scanner optimized for high-speed, high-resolution positioning. We present the design, finite-element simulations, and experimental characterization of a fast custom-built short-range scanner. The short-range scanner is based on electromagnetic actuation to provide high linearity, has a clean, high-bandwidth dynamical response and is equipped with a low-noise magnetoresistance-based sensor. By using advanced noise-resilient feedback controllers, the dual-stage system allows large-range positioning with subnanometer closed-loop resolution over a wide bandwidth. Experimental results are presented in which the dual-stage scanner system is used for imaging in a custom-built atomic force microscope.

AB  - In this work, various linear predictive feature vectors were used to train three different automated neural networks type classifiers for the task of isolated vowel recognition. The features used included linear prediction filter coefficients, reflection coefficients, log area ratios, and the linear predictive cepstrum. The three neural network classifiers used are the multilayer perceptron, radial basis function and the probabilistic neural network. The linear predictive cepstrum of dimension 12 is the best feature especially when training is done on clean speech and testing is done on noisy speech. Three different classifier fusion strategies (linear fusion, majority voting and weighted majority voting) were found to improve the performance. Linear fusion with varying weights is the best method and is most robust to noise.

AB  - This article proposes a novel approach to replace the fixed projection planes existed in the previous researches to reduce motion artifacts obtained from the human face by a normal webcam for monitoring heart rate in a real-time fashion. The novel projection plane is adaptively changed with the light intensity change to eliminate the color distortion induced by motion. In this article, the state-of-the-art semantic segmentation Deeplabv3+ is implemented to segment the skin pixels from the facial region that is detected by several trackers (Boosting, MIL, TLD, Median Flow, Mosse, and CSRT) to boost the computational time compared to the conventional face detection by Haar-Like features. Image and digital signal processing techniques are also applied to eliminate possible noise for obtaining a clean pulse signal. The proposed approach is compared with other existing approaches (Green, PCA, Chrom, and POS) in multiple challenges. From the experiments conducted, the Deeplabv3+ outperforms the conventional K-means for different kinds of skin segmentation. Moreover, the proposed approach is quite robust and stable in the stationary case (with the accuracy 96%), dim-lighting environment and the long-distance up to 4-m away without zooming in camera. Besides, multiple head-movement simulations and motions of fitness are conquered by the APP approach as shown in the experiments. Thus, it can be concluded that the proposed approach is applicable to surveillance or healthcare applications.

AB  - Objective: The wearable and portable Electroencephalogram (EEG) sensing systems are deeply interfered by unavoidable physiological artifacts due to the limited recording resources. In this work, an intelligent artifact removal system that handles single-channel EEG signals in the presence of mixed multi-type artifacts is investigated. Methods: The basic idea is to represent the mixed artifacts in contaminated varying EEG signals with the unchanged latent pattern features, and then employ the adaptive artifact removal scheme to separate the contamination and clean EEG signals in the encoded feature domain. To minimize the risks of corrupting clean signals and keeping artifacts by mistake, the artifact removal is formulated as an identification-removal two-stage minimization problem, and an attention based adaptive feature concentration mechanism is designed to improve the removal utility and reduce the calculation consumption. Results: In the real implementation on open real-world dataset, this study achieves the artifact identification accuracy of 98.52% and average correlation coefficient of 0.73 for the removal of strong mixed multi-type artifacts. Conclusion: This study can deal with single-channel EEG signals contaminated by mixed multi-type artifacts with high accuracy and low overhead, and is more effective and stable than traditional schemes with fixed criteria. Significance: This study can significantly improve the signal quality acquired by simplified EEG sensing systems, and may extend the application of wearable and portable EEG sensing systems to medical diagnosis, cognitive science research and other applications requiring clinical setups.

AB  - In this paper, we compare satellite-borne Cand X-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data for marine oil spill observation. During large-scale oil-on-water exercises in the North Sea, quad-polarization Radarsat-2 (C-band) and dual-polarization TerraSAR-X (X-band) data were acquired with temporal distances of less than 24 min. The objective is to characterize and quantify differences in the Radarsat-2 and TerraSAR-X measurements. Three scene pairs are compared in terms of data quality and signal characteristics, including statistical properties and selected multipolarization (HH, VV) parameters. The signal characteristics are also compared among low-backscatter features of various origin within the individual pairs. No viable argument for selecting one sensor above the other is identified in the data quality study. In the statistical analysis, investigation of logcumulants indicates a larger deviation from Gaussian statistics in the TerraSAR-X data compared with Radarsat-2 measurements. Log-cumulant diagrams are also shown to be a useful tool for discrimination between oil spills and a simulated biogenic slick in both sensors. Multipolarization features show enhanced slick-sea contrasts and a better discrimination between mineral oil spills and other low-backscatter features in Radarsat-2 compared with TerraSAR-X. The presence of a non-Bragg scattering component in the data is revealed for both sensors. The relative contribution of non-Bragg scattering to the total backscatter is found to be higher in the TerraSAR-X data than in the Radarsat-2 data. In general, the non-Bragg component is found to account for a larger part of the backscatter in slick-covered areas compared with clean sea.

AB  - Striping effects are a common phenomenon in remote-sensing imaging systems, and they can exhibit considerable differences between different sensors. Such artifacts can greatly degrade the quality of the measured data and further limit the subsequent applications in higher level remote-sensing products. Although a lot of destriping methods have been proposed to date, a few of them are robust to different types of stripes. In this paper, we conduct a thorough feature analysis of stripe noise from a novel perspective. With regard to the problem of striping diversity and complexity, we propose a universal destriping framework. In the proposed destriping procedure, a 1-D variational method is first designed and utilized to estimate the statistical feature-based guidance. The guidance information is then incorporated into 2-D optimization to control the image estimation for a reliable and clean output. The iteratively reweighted least-squares method and alternating direction method of multipliers are exploited in the proposed approach to solve the minimization problems. Experiments under various cases of simulated and real stripes confirm the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed model in terms of the qualitative and quantitative comparisons with other approaches.

AB  - Reliable visual features that encode the articulator movements of speakers can dramatically improve the decoding accuracy of automatic speech recognition systems when combined with the corresponding acoustic signals. In this paper, a novel framework is proposed to utilize audio-visual speech not only during decoding but also for training better acoustic models. In this framework, a multi-stream hidden Markov model is iteratively deployed to fuse audio and video likelihoods. The fused likelihoods are used to estimate enhanced frame-state alignments, which are finally used as better training targets. The proposed framework is so flexible that it can be partially used to train acoustic models with the available audio-visual data while a conventional training strategy can be followed with the remaining acoustic data. The experimental results show that the acoustic models trained using the proposed audio-visual framework perform significantly better than those trained conventionally with solely acoustic data in clean and noisy conditions.

AB  - The traditional denoising methods in noise robust synthetic aperture radar (SAR) automatic target recognition research are independent of the recognition model, which limits the robust recognition performance. In this article, we present a robust SAR automatic target recognition method via adversarial learning, which could integrate data denoising, feature extraction, and classification into a unified framework for joint learning. Different from the common recognition methods of directly inputting the SAR data into the classifiers, we add a dual-generative-adversarial-network (GAN) model between the SAR data and the classifier for data translation from a noise-polluted style to a relatively clean style to reduce the noise from SAR data. In order to ensure the target information in the SAR data can be retained during the data style translation, reconstruction constraint and label constraint are also used in the dual-GAN model. Then, the more reliable transferred SAR data are fed into the classifier. The parameters of the dual-GAN and classifier are learned through joint optimization in our method. Thus, the data separability is guaranteed in the process of denoising and feature extraction, which greatly improves the recognition performance of the method. In addition, our method can be easily extended to a semisupervised method by using different objective functions for labeled and unlabeled training data, which is more suitable for practical application. Experimental results on MSTAR dataset and Gotcha dataset show that our method can get the encouraging performance in the case of low signal-to-noise ratio and small labeled data size.

AB  - Free space estimation is an important problem for autonomous robot navigation. Traditional camera-based approaches train a segmentation model using an annotated dataset. The training data needs to capture the wide variety of environments and weather conditions encountered at runtime, making the annotation cost prohibitively high. In this work, we propose a novel approach for obtaining free space estimates from images taken with a single road-facing camera. We rely on a technique that generates weak free space labels without any supervision, which are then used as ground truth to train a segmentation model for free space estimation. Our work differs from prior attempts by explicitly taking label noise into account through the use of Co-Teaching. Since Co-Teaching has traditionally been investigated in classification tasks, we adapt it for segmentation and examine how its parameters affect performances in our experiments. In addition, we propose Stochastic Co-Teaching, which is a novel method to select clean samples that leads to enhanced results. We achieve an IoU of 82.6%, a Precision of 90.9%, and a Recall of 90.3%. Our best model reaches 87% of the IoU, 93% of the Precision, and 93% of the Recall of the equivalent fully-supervised baseline while using no human annotations. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to use Co-Teaching to train a free space segmentation model under explicit label noise. Our implementation and models are freely available online.

AB  - Due to the presence of motion artifacts (MAs), heart rate monitoring using PPG sensors in daily life and physical exercise is challenging, and there have been many studies on MA removal algorithms. However, most studies do not consider the quality evaluation of PPG signal before the MA removal. In this way, removing the MA directly regardless of whether there is motion artifact signal is not only a waste of computing resources, but also easy to introduce new noise. In this paper, the MA detection in PPG signal is performed by dividing the original signal into 6s signal segments and calculating the amplitude mean difference function (AMDF). Then the obtained AMDF is converted into a 2-D image through the Gramian Angular Field (GAF), and then classified by the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) classifier, so as to distinguish the contaminated signal and clean signal. In the subsequent processing, only the contaminated signal needs to remove the MAs, and the clean signal segment can be directly used for heart rate estimation. In this study, we achieve a classification accuracy of 0.966 in the local database, and a classification accuracy of 0.946 in the BIDMC PPG and Respiration Dataset published by PhysioNet. With the combination of feature extraction and SVM classifier, the proposed method has significantly improved the results.

AB  - Deep learning has shown a strong potential in device-free human activity recognition (HAR). However, a fundamental challenge is ensuring accuracy, without re-training, when exposing a previously trained architecture to a new or unseen environment. To overcome the aforementioned challenge, this paper proposes an environment-robust channel state information (CSI) based HAR by leveraging the properties of a matching network (MatNet) and enhanced features (HAR-MN-EF). To improve the CSI quality, we propose a CSI cleaning and enhancement method (CSI-CE) that includes two key stages: activity-related information extraction (ARIE) and correlation feature extraction based on principal component analysis (CFE-PCA). The ARIE stage is able to effectively enhance the activity-dependent features whilst mitigating behavior-unrelated information. The CFE-PCA stage further improves the extracted features by filtering out the residual activity-unrelated data and the residual noise contained in signals from the former stage. The extracted features are then sequenced into the MatNet to create an environment-robust HAR. Experimental results confirm that an architecture trained by the proposed HAR-MN-EF can be directly adapted to a new environment, achieving reliable sensing accuracies without requiring additional effort.

AB  - Modular Multilevel Converters (MMCs) have become one of the most popular power converters for medium/high power applications, from transmission systems to motor drives. However, to operate properly, MMCs require a considerable number of sensors and communication of sensitive data to a central controller, all under relevant electromagnetic interference produced by the high frequency switching of power semiconductors. This work explores the use of neural networks (NNs) to support the operation of MMCs by: i) denoising measurements, such as stack currents, using a blind autoencoder NN; and ii) estimating the sub-module capacitor voltages, using an encoder-decoder NN. Experimental results obtained with data from a three-phase MMC show that NNs can effectively clean sensor measurements and estimate internal states of the converter accurately, even during transients, drastically reducing sensing and communication requirements.

AB  - Electroencephalography has an important role in diagnoses of various brain disorders. Among these disorders, Epilepsy is the most common as 1% of world population is suffering from it. Being a neuroimaging technique, EEG is utilized in testing epilepsy (or seizures) while mapping the neural activity of the brain. EEG not only measures the electrical activity and continuous cortical changes with better time resolution but it also investigates the known or predicted seizures or epilepsy issues in the normal and abnormal subjects. The objective of this paper is to investigate the seizures, spikes or predicted epilepsy issues and their source localization in the suspected epilepsy subject while sleeping in the night. In the results, it is found that several sharp spikes or seizures are found in the entire EEG data particularly in the frontal sensory part of the brain. In order to investigate the seizures or spikes and their source localization, the EEG epileptic suspected data is firstly cleaned from the noises, and artifacts and other unwanted harmonics. This requires several pre-processing steps for such as cleaning, averaging, referencing, filtering, epoching and coupling the anatomical structure with the sensors and improving signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The analysis shows that left fronto-central part of the brain with the high amplitudes at the position of the electrodes (FC1, Cz) carries the sharp waves, poly-spikes and bursts of beta band activity especially during the sleep of the patient. This area is also located with the fixing goodness value above than 95% in a given time slot.

AB  - Point cloud segmentation is a fundamental task in 3D. Despite recent progress on point cloud segmentation with the power of deep networks, current deep learning methods based on the clean label assumptions may fail with noisy labels. Yet, object class labels are often mislabeled in real-world point cloud datasets. In this work, we take the lead in solving this issue by proposing a novel Point Noise-Adaptive Learning (PNAL) framework. Compared to existing noise-robust methods on image tasks, our PNAL is noise-rate blind, to cope with the spatially variant noise rate problem specific to point clouds . Specifically, we propose a novel point-wise confidence selection to obtain reliable labels based on the historical predictions of each point. A novel cluster-wise label correction is proposed with a voting strategy to generate the best possible label taking the neighbor point correlations into consideration. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of PNAL on both synthetic and real-world noisy datasets. In particular, even with 60% symmetric noisy labels, our proposed method produces much better results than its baseline counterpart without PNAL and is comparable to the ideal upper bound trained on a completely clean dataset. Moreover, we fully re-labeled the validation set of a popular but noisy real-world scene dataset ScanNetV2 to make it clean, for rigorous experiment and future research. Our code and data will be released.

AB  - HiPerSAT, a C++ library and tools, processes EEG data sets with ICA (independent component analysis) methods. HiPerSAT uses BLAS, LAPACK, MPI and OpenMP to achieve a high performance solution that exploits parallel hardware. ICA is a class of methods for analyzing a large set of data samples and extracting independent components that explain the observed data. ICA is used in EEG research for data cleaning and separation of spatiotemporal patterns that may reflect different underlying neural processes. We present two ICA implementations (FastICA and Info-max) that exploit parallelism to provide an EEG component decomposition solution of higher performance and data capacity than current MATLAB-based implementations. Experimental results and the methodology used to obtain them are presented. Integrating HiPerSAT with EEGLAB (A. Delorme and S. Makeig, 2004) is described, as well as future plans for this research.

AB  - Target motion analysis (TMA) with wideband passive sonar has received much attention. Maximum likelihood probabilistic data association (ML-PDA) represents an asymptotically efficient estimator for deterministic target motion, and is especially well suited for low-observable targets; the results presented here apply to situations with higher signal-to-noise ratio as well, including of course the situation of a deterministic target observed via “clean” measurements without false alarms or missed detections. Here we study the inverse problem, namely, how to identify the observing platform (following a “two-leg” motion model) from the results of the target estimation process, i.e., the estimated target state and the Fisher information matrix (FIM), quantities we assume an eavesdropper might intercept. We tackle the problem and we present observability properties, with supporting simulation results.

AB  - Seismicity-related anomaly analysis or earthquake precursor cognition is a great challenge for geo-electromagnetic signals mining and remote sensing application. To mining seismic anomaly from satellite data including microwave data is of extreme importance. A spatio-temporally weighted two-step method (STW-TSM) is developed to retrieve or to mine seismicity-related microwave brightness temperature (MBT) anomaly with microwave satellite big data from Aqua AMSR-E and/or FY-3B MWRI sensors. To remove the general trend of MBT to retrieve basic MBT residuals of the shocking year, historical microwave data were given varied time-weights according to respective time intervals with the shocking year. To eliminate the regional meteorological noise so as to retrieve cleaned MBT residuals actually related with seismic activities, adjacent pixels inside the seismic preparation zone were endowed with varied space-weights according to Euclidean distances away from the epicenter With Wenchuan earthquake sequence in May, 2008 and Nepal earthquake sequence in April and May, 2015 being case studies, this paper demonstrated the practical application of STW-TSM. Results showed that 1) significant strip-shaped MBT anomalies appeared near the epicenter of Wenchuan earthquake days before the main shocking and migrated with aftershocks moving northeastward 2) the horizontal strip MBT anomalies covered exactly the epicenters and seismic concentration zone of Nepal earthquakes during shocking days 3) the MBT anomaly zones behaved highly spatial overlap with geological quaternary strata and cliff-shaped mountainous region. The mined MBT anomalies are supposed to be related with the effects of rock dielectric constant variation, which is most likely to be caused by crust stress activated positive electricity carriers from deep crustal. This research is of particular meanings for mining MBT anomaly from satellite microwave big data, and for searching geo-electromagnetic signals related with seismicity.

AB  - Scene depth variation is an important factor that leads to spatially-varying camera motion blur. Most of the previous methods require auxiliary cameras or user interaction to make depth-aware deblurring tractable. In this work, we propose to use a noisy/blurred/noisy image sequence and simultaneously recorded inertial measurements to jointly estimate scene depth and remove spatially-varying blur caused by depth variation and camera in-plane motion. The inertial data could provide initialization of camera motion parameters, while the noisy image pair preserve large-scale sharp edges from which a coarse disparity map can be generated. However, this initial estimate is not accurate enough to produce a high-quality clean image. Therefore, we develop an optimization scheme to refine depth, motion parameters and latent image alternately. A Markov Random Field (MRF) framework is formulated to solve for the depth map by exploiting both stereo cues and motion blur cues and the residual Richardson-Lucy algorithm is used to effectively suppress deconvolution ringing artifacts. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach can address both depth estimation as well as image deblurring.

AB  - Single-view depth prediction is a fundamental problem in computer vision. Recently, deep learning methods have led to significant progress, but such methods are limited by the available training data. Current datasets based on 3D sensors have key limitations, including indoor-only images (NYU), small numbers of training examples (Make3D), and sparse sampling (KITTI). We propose to use multi-view Internet photo collections, a virtually unlimited data source, to generate training data via modern structure-from-motion and multi-view stereo (MVS) methods, and present a large depth dataset called MegaDepth based on this idea. Data derived from MVS comes with its own challenges, including noise and unreconstructable objects. We address these challenges with new data cleaning methods, as well as automatically augmenting our data with ordinal depth relations generated using semantic segmentation. We validate the use of large amounts of Internet data by showing that models trained on MegaDepth exhibit strong generalization-not only to novel scenes, but also to other diverse datasets including Make3D, KITTI, and DIW, even when no images from those datasets are seen during training.

AB  - The analysis of public transportation data is receiving an increasing amount of attention from the research community in the past few years. This interest is fueled by the widespread installation and open access to a variety of sensor technologies for collecting data on the state of the transport system in many cities around the world. Different cities provide different data sources and in many cases the only common dataset is represented by GPS data of the vehicle fleet. Very often, the data contain erroneous or missing information that should be corrected before proceeding with their analysis. In this paper, we propose a methodology to de-noise scheduled bus stops and detect time schedule information using GPS AVL (Automatic Vehicle Location) data. The methodology performs different sequential steps: i) cleaning process and detection of trips; ii) bus stop extraction; ii) bus stop clustering; iv) feature extraction; v) classification model construction and application. Moreover, the impact on the whole process of different methods applied in different steps is empirically evaluated on datasets with different temporal extent.

AB  - This paper presents a novel approach to tracking dynamic objects in 3D range data. Its key contribution lies in the generative object detection algorithm which allows the tracker to robustly extract objects of varying sizes and shapes from the observations. In contrast to tracking methods using discriminative detectors, we are thus able to generalize over a wide range of object classes matching our assumptions. Whilst the generative model underlying our framework inherently scales with the complexity and the noise characteristics of the environment, all parameters involved in the detection process obey a clean probabilistic interpretation. Nevertheless, our unsupervised object detection and tracking algorithm achieves real-time performance, even in highly dynamic scenarios covering a significant amount of moving objects. Through an application to populated urban settings, we are able to show that the tracking performance of the presented approach yields results which are comparable to state-of-the-art discriminative methods.

AB  - The structure of the cumulative food intake (CFI) curve has been associated with obesity and eating disorders. Scales that record the weight loss of a plate from which a subject eats food are used for capturing this curve; however, their measurements are contaminated by additive noise and are distorted by certain types of artifacts. This paper presents an algorithm for automatically processing continuous in-meal weight measurements in order to extract the clean CFI curve and in-meal eating indicators, such as total food intake and food intake rate. The algorithm relies on the representation of the weight-time series by a string of symbols that correspond to events such as bites or food additions. A context-free grammar is next used to model a meal as a sequence of such events. The selection of the most likely parse tree is finally used to determine the predicted eating sequence. The algorithm is evaluated on a dataset of 113 meals collected using the Mandometer, a scale that continuously samples plate weight during eating. We evaluate the effectiveness for seven indicators and for bite-instance detection. We compare our approach with three state-of-the-art algorithms, and achieve the lowest error rates for most indicators (24 g for total meal weight). The proposed algorithm extracts the parameters of the CFI curve automatically, eliminating the need for manual data processing, and thus facilitating large-scale studies of eating behavior.

AB  - There are various types and distributions of noise in hyperspectral images. However, the existing classification models are vulnerable to noise in the data. To improve the robustness of the classification models, a novel hyperspectral image classification model is proposed, named triple-regularized latent subspace discriminative regression (TRLSDR). The core idea of TRLSDR is to add a latent subspace to the standard discriminative least squares regression model to extract high-order features from the visual space by undercomplete autoencoder, and then use clean data for classification. Three regularizers are introduced in this process: Tikhonov regularizer is used to avoid overfitting; Laplacian regularizer is used to capture the neighborhood relationship; and low-rank regularizer is used to alleviate the error of Laplacian matrix construction caused by noise in original samples. We designed experiments on five hyperspectral image datasets and the results show that the proposed model is superior to the existing regression models.

AB  - This paper introduces a wearable Tele-ECG and heart rate (HR) monitoring system which has a novel architecture including a stretchable singlet redesigned with textile electrodes (TEs), textile threads, snap fasteners, Velcro, sponges, and an ECG circuit. In addition, a Bluetooth low energy (BLE), a smartphone, a server, and a web page have been added to the system for remote monitoring. The TE can be attached to and removed from the singlet by a Velcro, which allows the user to dry-clean the TE easily for long-term use. A new holter-based ECG system has been designed to evaluate the TE-based ECG system and the average correlation between the recorded ECG signals is obtained as 99.23%. A filtered digital signal, with a high signal-to-noise ratio of 45.62 dB, is transmitted to the smartphone via BLE. The ECG signal is plotted, the HR is calculated with 1.83% mean absolute percentage error, and displayed. The data are sent to the server, allowing the patient's physician to analyze the signals in real time through the web page or the smartphone. If HR reaches beyond the normal range or user presses the “HELP” button on the smartphone screen, the physician is informed automatically by an short message service (SMS) with a location pin on the map. The battery lasts approximately 14 days and when it needs replacement, the system automatically alerts the users by an SMS and a flashing LED. This fast and uninterrupted telemonitoring system has the potential to improve the patient's life quality by providing a psychological reassurance.

AB  - Image is one of the most important part of multi-media that is used in several areas from simple photography to medical and satellite imaging. In each field its usage and requirements are very different. So, an image required to be clean and free from artifacts to convey better information. But, acquisition is always associated with some sort of degradation that may be due to atmospheric conditions, camera sensors and/or lighting conditions. In this paper we are considering the degradation only due to noise and in specific additive Gaussian noise. Here, we are proposing to use a dual step approach for denoising. In the first step it uses stationary wavelet based denoising and in continuation to second step, a spatial domain method, Non-local means, is used to remove the artifacts. The simulation is done on both real and synthetic images and it shows an improvement over existing methods.

AB  - This paper reviews the second challenge on spectral reconstruction from RGB images, i.e., the recovery of whole- scene hyperspectral (HS) information from a 3-channel RGB image. As in the previous challenge, two tracks were provided: (i) a "Clean" track where HS images are estimated from noise-free RGBs, the RGB images are themselves calculated numerically using the ground-truth HS images and supplied spectral sensitivity functions (ii) a "Real World" track, simulating capture by an uncalibrated and unknown camera, where the HS images are recovered from noisy JPEG-compressed RGB images. A new, larger-than-ever, natural hyperspectral image data set is presented, containing a total of 510 HS images. The Clean and Real World tracks had 103 and 78 registered participants respectively, with 14 teams competing in the final testing phase. A description of the proposed methods, alongside their challenge scores and an extensive evaluation of top performing methods is also provided. They gauge the state-of-the-art in spectral reconstruction from an RGB image.
