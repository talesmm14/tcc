  abstract = {In this article, a method combining array signal processing and adaptive noise cancellation is proposed to suppress the ambient interferences of in-situ measurement. First, the directions of arrival and classes of all signals are obtained by performing blind source separation and sparse reconstruction on the received signals. Then, the received signals are reused to form two different data channels. In both channels, the interferences that are coherent with the radiated signals of the equipment under test and have larger amplitudes are eliminated based on null trap forming, whereas the coherent interferences with smaller amplitudes are ignored after being attenuated. Besides, the other interferences are suppressed by the adaptive noise cancellation based on their correlation in the two channels. For transient signals, overlapping window technique is used to avoid the losses of the spectrums. Each frame of the signals is cyclically extended to provide sufficient points for adaptive noise cancellation. The proposed method achieves the suppression of multisource ambient interferences with fewer array elements. Simulation and experiment results are given to verify the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed method.},

  abstract = {One of the biggest issues encountered in the analysis of sensitive electromyography (EMG) sensor data is the power line interference (PLI). Conventional methods in literature either lose valuable sensor data or inadequately decrease the power line noise. Instead of filtering out predetermined frequencies, adaptively estimating the spectrum of PLI can provide better performance. This paper introduces an online adaptive algorithm that removes the power line interference in real time without disturbing the true EMG data. Our method sequentially processes the biomedical signal to properly estimate and remove the PLI component. Through experiments with real EMG data, we compared our method to the five state-of-the-art techniques. Our algorithm outperformed all of them with the highest SNR gain (3.6 dB on average) and with the least disturbance of the true EMG signal (0.0152 dB loss on average). Our method reduces the PLI the most while keeping the valuable sensor data loss at its minimum in comparison to the state-of-the-art. Reducing the noise without disturbing the valuable sensor data provides higher quality signals with decreased interference, which can be better processed and used in biomedical research.},

  abstract = {In the actual integrated navigation process of the MEMS three-axis magnetometer, excessive measurement noise and external magnetic field interference often cause the magnetometer heading to be inaccurate, thereby reducing the overall performance of the integrated navigation system. In order to overcome the above influence, this paper proposes an adaptive real-time filtering noise reduction and comprehensive error interference compensation method. We have completed the construction of the measurement noise model and parameter update by analyzing the measurement noise characteristics of the MEMS three-axis magnetometer. We designed an adaptive filtering algorithm with multiple fading memory factors to perform offline noise reduction on the output data of the magnetometer, and use the noise-reduced data for comprehensive compensation of magnetic field interference, which has a good effect. The experimental results show that the proposed method has better filtering and noise reduction ability and higher compensation accuracy in offline state, can effectively reduce noise and compensate the magnetometer, and improve the accuracy of the magnetometer’s heading calculation.},

  abstract  = {In this paper, two practical problems that cannot be ignored when forming compactly integrated MEMS IMU array at low cost using Coriolis vibration type MEMS with low power consumption - mutual vibration interference noise caused by MEMS proximity arrangement, and outlier noise caused by random telegraph signal noise - are firstly discussed. Then, we propose an easily implementable array signal processing filtering on a small FPGA that recovers gyroscope performance (angle random walk and bias instability) by suppressing the interference noise and removing the outlier noise dynamically. We fabricated 32 consumer MEMS IMU array board without IMU screening process, implemented the proposed filter, and evaluated its performance. As a result, although there are mutual interferences and a MEMS gyro sensor with poor performance, gyroscope performance (0.7mdeg/s/√Hz as angle random walk and 0.5deg/h as bias instability) which are close to the ideal array gain of 1/√32 were successfully achieved.},

  abstract = {Noise reduction is one of the most important process used for signal processing in communication systems. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is a key parameter to consider for minimizing the bit error rate (BER). The inherent noise found in millimeter-wave systems is mainly a combination of white noise and phase noise. Increasing the SNR in wireless data transfer systems can lead to reliability and performance improvements. To address this issue, we propose to use a recurrent neural network (RNN) with a long short-term memory (LSTM) autoencoder architecture to achieve signal noise reduction. This design is based on a composite LSTM autoencoder with a single encoder layer and two decoder layers. A V-band receiver test bench is designed and fabricated to provide a high-speed wireless communication system. Constellation diagrams display the output signals measured for various random sequences of PSK and QAM modulated signals. The LSTM autoencoder is trained in real time using various noisy signals. The trained system is then used to reduce noise levels in the tested signals. The SNR of the designed receiver is of the order of 11.8dB, and it increases to 13.66dB using the three-level LSTM autoencoder. Consequently, the proposed algorithm reduces the bit error rate from 10−8 to 10−11. The performance of the proposed algorithm is comparable to other noise reduction strategies. Augmented denoised signals are fed into a ResNet-152 deep convolutional network to perform the final classification. The demodulation types are classified with an accuracy of 99.93%. This is confirmed by experimental measurements.},

  abstract = {In recent years, many studies have examined filters for eliminating or reducing speckle noise, which is inherent to ultrasound images, in order to improve the metrological evaluation of their biomedical applications. In the case of medical ultrasound images, said noise can produce uncertainty in the diagnosis because details, such as limits and edges, should be preserved. Most algorithms can eliminate speckle noise, but they do not consider the conservation of these details. This paper describes, in detail, 27 techniques that mainly focus on the smoothing or elimination of speckle noise in medical ultrasound images. The aim of this study is to highlight the importance of improving said smoothing and elimination, which are directly related to several processes (such as the detection of regions of interest) described in other articles examined in this study. Furthermore, the description of this collection of techniques facilitates the implementation of evaluations and research with a more specific scope. This study initially covers several classical methods, such as spatial filtering, diffusion filtering, and wavelet filtering. Subsequently, it describes recent techniques in the field of machine learning focused on deep learning, which are not yet well known but greatly relevant, along with some modern and hybrid models in the field of speckle-noise filtering. Finally, five Full-Reference (FR) distortion metrics, common in filter evaluation processes, are detailed along with a compensation methodology between FR and Non-Reference (NR) metrics, which can generate greater certainty in the classification of the filters by considering the information of their behavior in terms of perceptual quality provided by NR metrics.},

  abstract = {Comparing with the application of charge coupled device (CCD) sensor, a kind of interference stripe noise (ISN) can be observed easily from the complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) sensor-based digital holographic measurement (DHM) system because a series of optic coatings and filters are used in front of that sensor in order to improve its imaging effect. The improper assembly or the micro manufacturing error of these optic components may create the unexpected interference phenomena in the imaging sensor. To reduce that noise, an effective image processing method is developed. On one hand the Laplacian pyramid method is used to highlight the ISN and a cartoon-texture decomposition technique is carried out to remove the additive ISN. On the other hand, an improved Lee filtering is performed to restrain the multiplicative ISN. Extensive experiment results have shown that the image quality can be improved after the ISN reduction and this method is fit for solving a deionized water temperature estimation application where the texture complexity of target image is relatively low.},
